    "synopsis": "Frank McCourt's glorious childhood memoir, <I>Angela's Ashes</I>, has been loved and celebrated by readers everywhere for its spirit, its wit and its profound humanity. <h3>The Onion's. A.V. Club - Keith Phipps</h3> Frank McCourt's <i>Angela's Ashes</i>, a memoir about growing up under difficult circumstances in Brooklyn and Limerick, became an unexpected sensation a couple years ago, and deservedly so. McCourt, using delicate, direct prose, related the difficulty of an impoverished childhood troubled by a hard-drinking, irresponsible father. <i>Angela's Ashes</i> closes with McCourt's journey back to America, and its sequel, <i>Tis</i>, picks up almost precisely where its predecessor left off. If McCourt's patriotic closing sentiment in Ashes seemed a bit too simplistic, <i>Tis</i> makes it clear that America didn't immediately offer milk and honey to her prodigal son. Undereducated, unwashed, and plagued by eye troubles, McCourt struggles to carve out a life in New York, working as a busboy to the privileged in the '40s before joining the army and eventually returning to New York to resume his education.  McCourt is fine prose stylist and a colorful storyteller, and <i>'Tis</i>, for its first two thirds at least, proves a worthy successor to Angela's Ashes. As McCourt grows older on the page, however, the faux-naif narration that works so well in describing his life as a child and a young man begins to seem more like a device behind which to hide. Later chapters dealing with his marriage and teaching career prove less compelling and less cohesive: Some events (the dissolution of his marriage) seem out of the blue, while others (his own drinking) drop out of the narrative entirely. Closing chapters dealing with the death of McCourt's mother and father are quite moving, however, and readers of <i>Ashes</i> will no doubt find <i>Tis</i> a satisfying, if less essential, sequel. ",

Each wave different, and each wave stronger. </i></center><P><b><center>The Martian Chronicles</center></b><P>Ray Bradbury is a storyteller without peer, a poet of the possible, and, indisputably, one of America's most beloved authors. In a much celebrated literary career that has spanned six decades, he has produced an astonishing body of work&#58; unforgettable novels, including <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> and <i>Something Wicked This Way Comes;</i> essays, theatrical works, screenplays and teleplays; <i>The Illustrated Mein, Dandelion Wine, The October Country,</i> and numerous other superb short story collections. But of all the dazzling stars in the vast Bradbury universe, none shines more luminous than these masterful chronicles of Earth's settlement of the fourth world from the sun. <P>Bradbury's Mars is a place of hope, dreams and metaphor-of crystal pillars and fossil seas-where a fine dust settles on the great, empty cities of a silently destroyed civilization. It is here the invaders have come to despoil and commercialize, to grow and to learn -first a trickle, then a torrent, rushing from a world with no future toward a promise of tomorrow. The Earthman conquers Mars ... and then is conquered <i>by</i> it, lulled by dangerous lies of comfort and familiarity, and enchanted by the lingering glamour of an ancient, mysterious native race. <P>Ray Bradbury's <i>The Martian Chronicles</i> is a classic work of twentieth-century literature whose extraordinary power and imagination remain undimmed by time's passage. In connected, chronological stories, a true grandmaster once again enthralls, delights and challenges us with his vision and his heart-starkly and stunningly exposing in brilliant spacelight our strength, our weakness, our folly, and our poignant humanity on a strange and breathtaking world where humanity does not belong.<h3>Gale Research</h3>Russell Kirk feels that the greatest strength of <I>The Martian Chronicles </I>is its ability to make us look closely at ourselves. In <I>Enemies of the Permanent Things: Observations of Abnormality in Literature and Politics, </I> Kirk states: \"What gives [<I>The Martian Chronicles</I>] their cunning is ... their portrayal of human nature, in all its baseness and all its promise, against an exquisite stageset. We are shown normality, the permanent things in human nature, by the light of another world; and what we forget about ourselves in the ordinariness of our routine of existence suddenly bursts upon us as a fresh revelation.... Bradbury's stories are not an escape from reality; they are windows looking upon enduring reality.\"",

    "synopsis": "One of the most famous works of literature in the Western world, Plato's Symposium is also one of the most entertaining. The scene is a dinner party in Athens in 416 B.C. at which the guests - including the comic poet Aristophanes and Plato's mentor, Socrates - playfully discuss the nature of eros, or love. By turns earthly and sublime, the dialogue culminates with Socrates's famous account of the \"ladder of love,\" an extended analysis of the many forms of eros. The evening ends with a speech by the drunken Alcibiades, the most popular and powerful Athenian of the day, who insists on praising Socrates rather than love, offering up a brilliant character sketch of the enigmatic philosopher. This Modern Library edition is the authoritative translation by Benjamin Jowett, substantially revised by Dr. Hayden Pelliccia, associate professor of classics at Cornell University. This revised translation takes into account advances in scholarship since Jowett's day and modernizes the Victorian English where it is coy or archaic. The result is a translation neither too colloquial nor too literal, one that is faithful to both Jowett's superb prose and Plato's matchless original.",

    "synopsis": "<P>Now available in paperback, the entrancing story of how one woman's journey of self-discovery gave her the courage to persevere in re-creating her life.<P>Life is a work in progress, as ever-changing as a sandy shoreline along the beach. During the years Joan Anderson was a loving wife and supportive mother, she had slowly and unconsciously replaced her own dreams with the needs of her family. With her sons grown, however, she realized that the family no longer centered on the home she provided, and her relationship with her husband had become stagnant. Like many women in her situation, Joan realized that she had neglected to nurture herself and, worse, to envision fulfilling goals for her future. As her husband received a wonderful job opportunity out-of-state, it seemed that the best part of her own life was finished. Shocking both of them, she refused to follow him to his new job and decided to retreat to a family cottage on Cape Cod.<br>At first casting about for direction, Joan soon began to take plea-sure in her surroundings and call on resources she didn't realize she had. Over the course of a year, she gradually discovered that her life as an &quot;unfinished woman&quot; was full of possibilities. Out of that magical, difficult, transformative year came <b>A Year by the Sea</b>, a record of her experiences and a treasury of wisdom for readers.<br>This year of self-discovery brought about extraordinary changes in the author's life. The steps that Joan took to revitalize herself and rediscover her potential have helped thousands of woman reveal and release untapped resources within themselves. <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> \"I'm beginning to think that real growing only begins after we've done the adult things we're supposed to do,\" confides Anderson, a journalist and author of children's books (Twins on Toes, etc.). She came to this conclusion after a year living alone in a cottage on Cape Cod. Feeling that her marriage had stagnated by the time her two sons were grown, Anderson surprised and distressed her husband by refusing to move out-of-state with him when he accepted a new job. In this accessible memoir, she shares the joy and self-knowledge she found during her time of semi-isolation. In order to supplement the income from her royalty checks, she found a job in the local fish market and began making new friends who sustained her. After her hot water heater broke down and her husband refused to help, she earned the additional money for the repair by digging and selling clams. Through vivid and meticulous observations about the natural world, Anderson makes clear her strong affinity for the ocean, with its changing tides, subtle colors and burgeoning life. A Memorial Day reunion brought Anderson and her husband closer; shortly thereafter she embraced his plan to retire and live with her in the cottage. Anderson has recently begun a \"Weekend by the Sea\" program for women who need time to reflect. (Apr.)",

    "synopsis": "New York Times best-selling author of Out of the Shadows and Touching Evil, Kay Hooper delivers a thrilling paranormal mystery with Whisper of Evil. Forced by a sense of duty and a need to reconcile the past, a woman with psychic powers faces a far greater challenge than she'd ever expected. A stalker? In Silence? These are the questions on Nell Gallagher's mind as she drives through the empty streets of her hometown. Three successful, respected members of the community&mdash;each harboring a dark secret&mdash;have fallen to a killer's murderous vengence. When Nell teams up with former high school sweetheart Max Tanner, they realize that the very skills that drove her away from Silence have become the town's only hope for salvation. But even as she pieces together the puzzle of the killer's imagination, he may already be so close that she won't even see her own death coming. This exciting book will hold new and longtime Hooper fans in a spell of suspense. Every gripping chapter is filled...<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>Pages upon pages of pseudoscientific explanations and stale dialogue clutter up Whisper of Evil, the newest in Kay Hooper's paranormal mystery series (after Touching Evil). Reluctant psychic Nell Gallagher never planned to return home to Silence, especially not to settle the affairs of her father, whom she hated, or to help solve a string of murders that has the local sheriff scratching his head. But before long, she teams up with her old high school flame, Max Tanner, to root out the killer. While the romantic tension between Nell and Max is strong, the book's action is virtually nonexistent. Instead, Hooper fills her story with unwieldy discussions of psychic powers, energy fields and electric brain impulses. Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information.",

    "synopsis": "One of America&#39;s bestselling authors returns with a tale about the greatest commitment of all: loving someone forever. When a near-fatal car crash brings Taylor McAden together with Denise Holden, a new resident of Edenton, North Carolina, he must look into his past to see if it&#39;s not too late to take a chance on the future.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>Secret traumas again haunt Sparks's characters, in the author's fourth novel (after The Notebook; Message in a Bottle; A Walk to Remember). Denise Holden, the 29-year-old heroine, is destitute and forced to live in her mother's old house in Edenton, N.C. She's also the single mother of a handicapped child, Kyle, a four-year-old with \"auditory processing problems\" that render him unable to express himself or to fully understand others. Though she doesn't suspect it, Denise is on a literal collision course with true love. After she smashes her car into a tree and wakes up to discover Kyle missing, she finds deliverance in the form of Taylor McAden, dashing firefighter and compulsive risk taker, who rescues Kyle, too. Since Taylor enjoys an instant, unprecedented rapport with Kyle, there is little standing in the way of burgeoning romance. Trouble comes, however, when Denise learns of Taylor's checkered romantic past. Taylor's inability to commit, it seems, is somehow tied to his compulsive heroism, of which numerous histrionic examples are described. Denise's quest to find the source of Taylor's emotional distance takes up the final third of the book. The story here is mostly a pretext for the emotional assault that Sparks delivers, but when he manages to link affect to action, the result is cunningly crafted melodrama. These occasions are rare, though; more often Sparks gets bogged down in interminable interior monologue. Because these characters are preordained lovers, their feelings prescribed by fiction conventions, their psychology amounts to little more than a profusion of banality. Yet Sparks's narrative acquires immediacy when his characters' exaggerated emotions compel immoderate actions, and his readers will surely delight at these moments of heightened expressiveness. 1 million first printing; 24-city author tour.

A buffoon burdened with a brimming heart, Harlequin chases his sensible, oblivious Columbine around the city streets, having given his heart freely. Consumed with love, the impulsive clown sees his heart dragged about town, with a charming surprise to bend the tale in a modern direction.Gaiman's writing is poetic and as heartfelt as the subject matter. Bolton's art, a combination of digitally enhanced photorealism and dynamic painting, provides sensational depth with bright characters over fittingly muted backgrounds. Those who have spent Valentine's Day alone are aware that the cold February holiday can be hard to swallow. Gaiman and Bolton want you to know that all it takes is a steak knife, a fork, and a bottle of quality ketchup!",

    "synopsis": "the Romance Reader Invites Us To Enter The Hasidic World As Few Have Ever Seen It - Through The Eyes Of A Young Woman On The Brink Of Adulthood. The Daughter Of A Visionary Rabbi Who Dreams Of Founding His Own Synagogue And Center Of Learning, Rachel Benjamin Lives In An Insular Environment, Seemingly Protected From The Temptations And Freedoms The Modern World Offers. As The Eldest Of Seven Siblings, She Is Expected To Set A Moral Example Within Her Family And The Community: She Must Wear Thick Opaque Tights With Seams; She Must Never Wear A Bathing Suit In Public; She Is Not To Read Books In English. Rachel Is A Dreamer Like Her Father; But Her Dreams Are Of The Strong, Confident Men And The Beautiful Damsels In Distress She Reads About In Romance Novels She Sneaks Under Her Blankets At Night. Secretly She Begins To Wear Sheer Stockings To School, Concealed Under High Boots, And Takes Classes To Become A Lifeguard. She Longs To Live Not In The Dying, Desolate Community Of A Bungalow Colony In Upstate New York, Where She Can't Help But Be Aware Of The Presence And Allures Of The Secular World Surrounding Her, But In Brooklyn - In Williamsburgh Or Borough Park - Where The Hasidic World Is Sufficient Unto Itself And She Could More Easily Be The Good Hasidic Daughter She Is Trying To Be. Unlike Her Siblings And Friends, Rachel Craves The Independence She Will Never Have As A Hasidic Woman In An Arranged Marriage. And Yet, As Her Engagement Draws Inevitably Nearer, The Strong Pulls Of Family And Tradition, Weigh Against The Frightening Unknown Beyond Her - The Secular World She Knows Only Through Her Beloved Romance Novels.<h3>publishers Weekly</h3>abraham Shows Strong Talent In Her Debut Novel, The Story Of A Young Girl's Coming-of-age In An Ultraorthodox Hasidic Home. The Reader Soon Cares Deeply About Narrator Rachel, The Eldest Of Six Children, Who Yearns For Some Of The Forbidden Fruits Of The Secular World. Her Rebbe Father Is Another Endearing Character; He Dreams Of Establishing A Major Synagogue And Learning Center Even While He Desperately Looks For A 10th Man For A Minyan For His Sparse Congregation. Most Of The Story Takes Place In A Suburban Community That Receives An Influx Of Hasidim In The Summer Months; For The Rest Of The Year, The Rebbe's Family Is The Neighborhood Curiosity. Rachel Is A Dutiful Child Who Tries Hard To Please Her Mother, An Angry Woman Who Belittles Her Husband's Dreams And Wants To Be Part Of One Of Brooklyn's Larger Hasidic Enclaves. Rachel's Glimpses Of The Larger World Come From Casual And Often Uncomfortable Encounters With Non-jews And Secular Jews In Her Town, But Especially From Romance Novels, Which She Reads Secretly. Her Seemingly Flagrant Behavior (she Refuses To Wear Seamed, Opaque Stockings, Opting Instead For Seamless, And Will Not Wear A Cover-up Over Her Bathing Suit While Teaching Young Girls To Swim) Brings Shame To Her Family And Endangers A Marital Opportunity For Her Brilliant Younger Brother. Despite Her Resolve To Establish A More Independent Life, Rachel Agrees To An Arranged Marriage, Both To Make Her Family Happy And As A First Step Toward A New Existence. When This Match Goes Awry, Rachel's Solution Is Both Funny And Bittersweet. Abraham's Intense, Sensitive Prose And Her Ability To Create Vivid Scenes And Memorable Characters Augment This Authentic, Often Disturbing, Look At Hasidic Home Life And Beliefs.

Here, he combines a science of the future -- the emerging field of quantum technology -- with the complex realities of the medieval past.

All The Elements Are In Place: An Appealing, Plucky Working-girl Heroine Placed In Instant Danger; A Virile, Adoring Would-be Lover Kept At Arm's Length Until The Curtain; A Cute Moppet (also In Danger); A Doting But Somewhat Foolish Mother; A Dead Dad Whose Spirit Is Ever-present In Times Of Crisis. What's Lacking Is Any Real Suspense, Or, In This Case, A Satisfactory Windup. Lacey Farrell Is A Comely Young Real Estate Saleswoman In Manhattan Who Has A Client, Isabelle Waring, Murdered Virtually Before Her Eyes, Then Has To Spend Most Of The Book On The Run From The Killer, Whom Only She Can Identify. In The Process She Goes Into The Witness Protection Program, And The Most Interesting Part Of The Novel (clark Is Always Good On Research) Is The Details On How This Works. The Plot, However-involving Isabelle's Certainty That Her Daughter Was Murdered, The Suspicion That Falls On The Wealthy Man Who Owns Lacey's Real Estate Firm And His Scapegrace Son, And A Hit Man Who Remorselessly Pursues Lacey-is Perfunctory In The Extreme. When The Real Villain Is Finally Unmasked-in A Few Throwaway Sentences-the Reader Has Almost Forgotten He Existed And Is Given No Clue As To How And Why He Did All His Evil Deeds. Maybe 13 Isn't Clark's Lucky Number.",

With A Husband She Barely Knew, The Young Bride Arrived At This Immense Estate, Only To Be Inexorably Drawn Into The Life Of The First Mrs. De Winter, The Beautiful Rebecca, Dead But Never Forgotten...her Suite Of Rooms Never Touched, Her Clothes Ready To Be Worn, Her Servant &#151; The Sinister Mrs. Danvers &#151; Still Loyal. And As An Eerie Presentiment Of Evil Tightened Around Her Heart, The Second Mrs. De Winter Began Her Search For The Real Fate Of Rebecca...for The Secrets Of Manderley.<h3>library Journal</h3>surely No Audiobook Collection Should Be Without Some Version Of This Timeless Classic, Arguably The Most Famous And Well-loved Gothic Novel Of The 20th Century, And This Production Would Be An Excellent Choice. Read In Wonderfully British Cadences By Anna Massey, All The Mysterious And Oppressive Nuances Are Made Immediate And Chilling. We Even Feel Some Sympathy For The Absurdly Timid And Cowering Heroine; It Is, After All, Easy To Imagine Feeling Woefully Inferior To The Predecessor And Desperately Eager To Please. Of Course The Story Requires Great Leaps Of Credulity; Imagine A New Bride Hearing Her Husband Confessing To The Cold-blooded Killing Of His First Wife And Disposing Of Her Body, And Him Ultimately Getting Away With Murder, All Without Turning A Hair, Glad Only To Find That He Had Not Even Loved The Glorious Rebecca So They Can Live Happily Ever After. Not How You Remember It? Forget The Movie; It Makes Mincemeat Of The Actual Tale. A Wise Seven-year-old Once Told Me, The Book Is Always Better--it Goes Right Into Your Head. This Is A Prime Example--listen Again; It Gets Even Better. Highly Recommended.--harriet Edwards, East Meadow P.l., Ny Copyright 2000 Cahners Business Information.\\",

    "synopsis": "<P>Firekeeper only vaguely remembers a time when she didn't live with her \"family,\" a pack of \"royal wolves\"-bigger, stronger, and smarter than normal wolves. Now her pack leaders are sending her back to live among the humans, as they promised her mother years ago.<P>Some of the humans think she may be the lost heir to their throne. This could be good-and it could be very, very dangerous. In the months to come, learning to behave like a human will turn out to be more complicated than she'd ever imagined.<P>But though human ways might be stranger than anything found in the forest, the infighting in the human's pack is nothing Firekeeper hasn't seen before. That, she understands just fine. She's not your standard-issue princess-and this is not your standard-issue fairy tale. <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> This engrossing tale of feral myth and royal intrigue from Lindskold (Changer; Lord Demon and Donnerjack with Roger Zelazny) offers plenty of action as well as fascinating anthropological detail on the social behavior of wolves. From the wilderness to a kingdom bereft of royal heirs the ambitious Earl Kestrel brings Firekeeper, a young woman raised by magically enhanced wolves who promised her mother their care and her eventual reintroduction to human society. Firekeeper's new companions under the earl's protection include Derian Carter, who becomes her tutor and adviser; her wolf brother, Blind Seer (named for his un-lupine blue eyes, thought a deformity in puppyhood), who is now of an age to leave the pack and ramble; and the falcon Elation, another magically enhanced being, who spent a year as a captive hunter among humans and is adept at interpreting human language and actions. Many nobles dismiss Firekeeper as \"little more than a freak,\" but wolf society proves a useful preparation for court intrigue: she \"seemed to have no difficulty interpreting the relative degrees of importance\" in social situations. Though she knows she'll never discard her wolf nature entirely, she finds mingling with her biological kind oddly rewarding, especially after dancing and music raise her opinion of the two-legs. Magic plays a minor if increasingly significant role. Maps and a family tree enhance a beautiful and complex book. (Aug. 29) Forecast: With blurbs from Charles de Lint as well as David Weber and S.M. Sterling, plus good word of mouth, this novel could run ahead of the pack on genre bestseller lists. Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information.",

The murder weapon belongs to the candidate, Kenneth Ewald, and his son is the chief suspect. Out of the classroom comes professor Mac Smith to tackle a case that is bad for the senator, but may prove disastrous for the nation....<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>Likely to follow Truman's eight earlier mysteries up the bestseller lists, her ninth opens with a grand performance at the Kennedy Center honoring Senator Ewald, favored to win his party's nomination for president. But hopes dim after the extravaganza when Professor MacKenzie (Mac) Smith finds an Ewald campaign worker, Andrea Feldman, shot dead behind the Center. The senator's son Paul, who has been sexually involved with Andrea, is arrested for the murder, whereupon his wife, Janet, disappears. As a professor of law and Ewald's friend, Mac uses his skills to investigate those in Ewald's orbit. The suspects include the senator's wife, Leslie, his campaign manager, Ed Farmer, and a host of others capable of murder so as to cause a scandal ruinous to the candidate. At last, Mac penetrates the mystery, thickly layered in the complexities of Washington political processes, once again brought vividly to life by Truman's expertise. Literary Guild main selection.

Looking for inspiration and a cheap place to live off his dwindling royalty check, over-the-hill writer Danny Pastor has come to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, where he spends most of his time having steamy sex with Luz, a young peasant notable for her sordid past as a prostitute, her dreams of one day reaching El Norte and her obscene way of eating ice cream cones. The book opens with Danny witnessing the murder of an American naval officer; later that same night, he and Luz run into the killer in a bar. The shooter (which is how he is identified for most of the novel) offers Danny $3000 to drive him to the border, and Danny, sniffing material for a book that could remake his name, agrees. As the narrative progresses, it is the ``silver-haired'' shooter, Clayton Price, who emerges as the Waller hero, a man who honed his skills as a sniper in Vietnam, was captured and tortured by the Vietnamese and who became an assassin largely, we gather, out of loneliness. That particular problem is eventually solved by Luz, who teaches the shooter to dance (among other things). Meanwhile, various branches of the U.S. government are organizing a manhunt: the shooter, it turns out, had been working for a covert operations unit but had let his ``one personal vendetta'' get in the way of professionalism. As the trio make their way towards the border, they are slowly surrounded by a small army, allowing Waller several occasions to demonstrate his complete inability to write an action scene. These characters are flatter than cardboard, their situation is extremely unconvincing and the book is singularly devoid of suspense. But these weaknesses are nothing compared to the prose, which reads like an illiterate's imitation of Hemingway. Even the faithful may want to think twice about this one.

    "synopsis": "One of the secrets of real magic is that it is controlled by the mind. The more things in your ritual to help your mind associate with your goal, the more powerful your ritual may be. Colored candles, scented oils, natural incenses, and more all add to the impact of the magic you wish to do. But how do you know which incense to burn? Is it possible to add scented oils together to get a more powerful oil? And how do you make your own appropriately-scented tools?\nThe answers to questions like these and hundreds more can be found in <b>The Complete Book of Incense, Oils and Brews</b> by world-famous author Scott Cunningham. This is a greatly expanded and rewritten version of <b>The Magic of Incenses, Oils and Brews.</b> It includes over 100 new formulas, proportions for each element of the recipes (the most requested feature from his previous book), how to substitute ingredients, and much more. Besides the formulas, it also includes the exact methods of making all of these scented tools, including how to extract the essences from the herbs.\nEach one of the formulas in this magic book is precise and easy to make. Do you need luck? Take 2 parts vetivert, 2 parts allspice, 1 part nutmeg, and 1 part calamus, grind them together as finely as possible, then sprinkle the powder in a circle around you, beginning and ending in the East and moving clockwise. Sit within this circle and absorb the powder's energies. Also included are other ways to use magical powders that will have you coming up with your own ideas for them, too.\nThere is a legion of recipes for incenses. There are three for the sun and two for consecrating talismans. There are incenses for each of the astrological signs and ones to help you study better and gain success. You'll also find incenses for each of the planetary influences. There are four for Saturn alone!\nThis compendium of magical lore is a vital tool for every magical person on any magical path, whether you are a beginner or an expert.",

    "synopsis": "Standing Firm Leaves No Doubt That Dan Quayle Is The Most Misjudged Figure In Modern Political History. Prior To 1988, Quayle Had Never Lost An Election. Not For Congress. Not Even For The Senate. Heading Into That Year's Republican Convention, Quayle Was Considered One Of The Party's Brightest Young Stars - A Man Of Unusual Political Instincts Who, When It Came To Campaigning, Had A Reputation As A Giant Killer. He Would Become The First In His Generation To Hold National Office, But Only After A Tumultuous Contest That Frequently Put Him On The Defensive. With Gritty Honesty And Admirable Self-deprecation, Quayle Describes What It Was Like To Weather That 1988 Media Storm, And The Other Squalls That Followed. Poignantly, He Also Talks Of The Self-confidence And Christian Faith That Gave Him The Courage To Stand Firm And Record Some Of The Most Noteworthy Contributions Of Any Vice President Ever. Among The High Points: His Coordination Of America's Response To A Coup Attempt In The Philippines, The Details Of Which Have Never Been Reported; His Bringing The Family-values Issue To The Fore With The Murphy Brown Speech - A Call For Action That, One Year Later, Would Even Draw Support From Democratic President Bill Clinton; His Use Of The White House Competitiveness Council To Curtail Harmful Overregulation; His Unreported Diplomacy With Latin American Leaders; And His Championing Of Legal Reform, Which Would Earn Him The Strongest Praise Of His Vice-presidency. Quayle Pulls No Punches When It Comes To Assessing Himself And Other Players In The Bush Administration - The Men And Women Who Were His Allies, And Sometimes His Opponents, In Helping George Bush Spread Democracy Around The World. He Shares Entries From His Diary Of The Persian Gulf Crisis, Offers A Surprising Snapshot Of What The Typical Bush Cabinet Meeting Was Like, Describes Intramural Battles Waged By White House Power Brokers, And Reveals His Special Relationship With The President. Quayle, A Former Journalist, Interviewed Several Members Of The Press For This Book, And Their Contributions Form A Vital Part Of Its Fabric. Standing Firm Is Perhaps Most Intriguing In Its Analysis Of What Went Wrong In The 1992 Election. Quayle Does Not Hesitate To Place Blame Where It Is Deserved - In Fact, He Reserves Some Of The Strongest Criticism For Himself. Throughout, The Portrait That Emerges Of The Former Vice President Is That Of A Man Whose Good Humor Is Exceeded Only By A Competence For Which He Has Never Been Fully Credited.

    "synopsis": "<P>Alice Bullock is a young newlywed whose husband, Charlie, has just joined the Union Army, leaving her on his Iowa farm with only his formidable mother for company. Equally talented at sewing and gossip, and not overly fond of hard work, Alice writes lively letters to her sister filled with accounts of local quilting bees, the rigors of farm life, and the customs of small-town America. But no town is too small for intrigue and treachery, and when Alice finds herself accused of murder, she must rely on support from unlikely sources.<P>Rich in details of quilting, Civil War-era America, and the realities of a woman's life in the nineteenth century, <i>Alice's Tulips</i> is Sandra Dallas at her best, a dramatic and heartwarming tale of friendship, adversity, and triumph.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>Loyalty, trust and friendship are the themes of Dallas's (The Persian Pickle Club) cozy, suspense-driven epistolary novel, set during the Civil War. When her husband enlists as a Union soldier, teenage newlywed Alice Keeler Bullock must live on his family's Bramble Farm on the outskirts of Slatyfork, Iowa, with only her stern mother-in-law, Mother (Serena) Bullock, for company. Alice is lonely without the constant companionship of her sister, Lizzie, and their six younger brothers. She passes the time writing long, gossip-filled letters to Lizzie in Galena, Ill., and growing passionate about her quilting. Newly pregnant, Alice hopes that the baby will win over her fault-finding mother-in-law, but Alice doesn't make things easy for herself. She regularly boasts about her superior sewing skills, yearns aloud for fashionable clothing and speaks before she thinks. In other words, she is young and ignorant of the ways of the world, which leads to trouble with a Confederate sympathizer, Samuel Smead, who, encouraged by Alice's innocent flirtations, pursues her with an intensity that tarnishes her reputation. Meanwhile, Alice slowly makes friends with girls her own age, including Samuel's sister-in-law, Nealie, and a runaway mother, Annie, seeking shelter for herself and her blind daughter. As the story unfolds, secrets and mysteries abound, and Alice shares every joy and sorrow with her sister by letter, a credible narrative form except when Alice reproduces extended dialogue. The last third of the novel is a delicate balance between sentiment and tragedy; in some instances, the secrets spilled go over the top, with no adequate motives for why characters are so cruel. Alice is a feisty Northern counterpart to Scarlett O'Hara, however, and her irreverent humor and precise expression will keep readers entertained. First serial to Good Housekeeping; author tour.

    "synopsis": "Deep in London's dangerous slums, Victorians transacted their most secret and shameful business. For a price, a man could procure whatever he wanted, but it happened now and then that the price he paid was his life.Now, in sunless Water Lane, respected solicitor Leighton Duff lies dead, kicked and beaten to death. Beside him lies the barely living body of his son, Rhys. The police cannot fathom these brutal assaults until shrewd investigator William Monk uncovers a connection between them and a series of rapes and beatings of local prostitutes. Then, shockingly, it begins to appear that young Rhys may have killed his own father. . . .<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>Although lacking the panache of last year's <i>Weighted in the Balance</i>, William Monk's eighth outing adds to Perry's convincing yet disturbing picture of early Victorian London. Hired to find men whose evening entertainment runs to raping and beating prostitutes in the slum of St. Giles, Monk soon brushes up against murder: Leighton Duff, a respectable solicitor, was found beaten to death in St. Giles, with his son, Rhys Duff, nearby, barely alive. Despite his receiving excellent care from Hester Latterly, the nurse with whom Monk shares a volatile relationship, physical and emotional injuries have reduced Rhys to virtual silence: he can't speak and his hands are broken. Inquiries conducted by Monk and by the police suggest that Rhys was in the right place to beat the women (which interests police not at all) and murder Leighton (which interests them greatly). But, as in other Perry mysteries, it takes more than one perspective to reveal the truth, and Latterly maintains that Rhys, despite his displays of inarticulate rage, is innocent. When Latterly recruits barrister Sir Oliver Rathbone to Rhys's cause, and Sir Oliver naturally hires Monk to gather evidence, the investigator must question what he thinks he knows. Although the young man's silence and the suspicions surrounding him are ultimately resolved and tied neatly into the plot, readers may feel they are bearing the weight of this contrivance like so much overpacked luggage.

    "synopsis": "\"Thought-provoking and charming.\"--<I>Library Journal</I> Not all Great Masters of Wisdom are venerable graybeards. One is as familiar to us as that beloved teddy bear Winnie the Pooh. From the \"how\" of Pooh to the Tao of Pooh is a simple, effortless, joyous step...a delicious journey to Pooh Corner illuminated by the timeless teachings of the Taoist immortals. <h3>Library Journal</h3> Author/narrator Hoff calls Winnie the Pooh a ``Western Taoist'' and uses the unassuming bear to introduce Eastern philosophical principles. Pooh epitomizes the ``uncarved block,'' as he is well in tune with his natural inner self. Pooh enjoys simple pleasures and the daily progress of life. Hoff contrasts this unpretentiousness to other characters created by Winnie - the - Pooh author A.A. Milne, including Owl, whom he describes as a ``mind that tries too hard,'' and Eeyore, the eternal pessimist. In a clear and crisp voice, Hoff explains the central tenets of Taoism and further illustrates them with familiar excerpts from The House at Pooh Corner stories (1923), Chinese proverbs, maxims, and tales from Lao Tzu and others. The result is at once thought-provoking and charming. This is a small literary event that will leave all who experience it a little more serene. For most collections.-- Jeanne P.

So too come startling revelations&#58; the painful price Lyra must pay to walk through the land of the dead, the haunting power of Dr. Malone's amber spyglass, and the names of who will live and who will die for love. And all the while, war rages with the Kingdom of Heaven, a brutal battle that in its shocking outcome will uncover the secret of Dust.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>\"In concluding the spellbinding Dark Materials trilogy, Pullman produces what may well be the most controversial children's book of recent years,\" wrote PW. As he asks readers to examine the ideas of organized religion, \"Pullman riffs on the elemental chords of classical myth and fairytale. Stirring and highly provocative.\" Ages 12-up.

Now Mark is caught&#160;&#160;between a legal system gone mad and a mob killer&#160;&#160;desperate to cover up his crime. And his only ally is&#160;&#160;a woman named Reggie Love, who has been a lawyer&#160;&#160;for all of four years. Prosecutors are&#160;&#160;willing to break all the rules to make Mark talk. The&#160;&#160;mob will stop at nothing to keep him quiet. And&#160;&#160;Reggie will do anything to protect her client &#151;&#160;&#160;even take a last, desperate gamble that could win&#160;&#160;Mark his freedom... or cost them both their&#160;&#160;lives.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>Fans of the bestselling Grisham will be pleased to note that he is once more on Firm ground: his latest legal thriller offers a clever, compelling plot coupled with two singular protagonists sure to elicit readers' empathy. Eleven-year-old Mark Sway, taking his kid brother for a smoke behind their Memphis trailer park, witnesses the suicide of a lawyer ``driven crazy'' by a lethal secret. Before he dies, the man confides to Mark where the body of a recently murdered U.S. senator lies buried, and the game's afoot. Trailed by the police, the FBI and assorted Mafia types (the deceased politico was the victim of ``a successful New Orleans street thug''), Mark retains--for one dollar--the services of Reggie Love, a 50ish female lawyer. This uncommon attorney-client relationship adds an affecting, unusually humanistic layer to the novel's tension-filled events. Mark, raised by a divorced mother and wise beyond his years, thinks chiefly in terms of movies and TV; Reggie, a street-smart survivor of an acrimonious divorce, is often unsure whether to hug or slug her precocious client. True to form, Grisham employs just enough foreshadowing to keep the suspense rolling (``Neither of them could know that . . . ''), and propels his action at the requisite breakneck pace. Occasional plot improbabilities and stylistic quibbles--a few fuzzy characterizations; overstatement of already obvious points; Mark's sporadic adult phraseology--will not deter readers from enjoying a rousing read. 950,000 first printing; Literary Guild and Doubleday Book Club main selections; Reader's Digest Condensed Book selection.

    "synopsis": "<P>From the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Circle of Friends, The Glass Lake,</i> and <i>Evening Class</i> comes a stunning collection of fifteen Christmas stories filled with Maeve Binchy's trademark wit, charm, and sheer storytelling genius.&#160;&#160;In &quot;A Typical Irish Christmas,&quot; a grieving widower heads for a holiday in Ireland and finds an unexpected destination not just for himself, but for a father and daughter in crisis. . . .&#160;&#160;In &quot;Pulling Together,&quot; a teacher not yet out of her twenties sees her affair with a married man at a turning point as Christmas Eve approaches. . . .&#160;&#160;And in the title story, &quot;This Year It Will Be Different,&quot; a woman with a complacent husband and grown children enters a season that will forever alter her life, and theirs. . . <P>These stories, and a dozen more, powerfully evoke many lives&#151;from step-families grappling with exes to children caught in grown-up tugs-of-war&#151;during the one holiday when feelings cannot be easily hidden.&#160;&#160;The time of year may be magical, imbued with meaning.&#160;&#160;But the situations are timeless.&#160;&#160;And Maeve Binchy makes us care about them all.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>That Binchy (<i>Circle of Friends</i>) would choose to enter the Christmas market should not be a surprise. Her wide audience enjoys the warmth of her fiction, the emphasis on the power of love to transform ordinary lives even as she acknowledges that for some people, love is elusive or the prelude to frustration and heartbreak. Here she presents 15 short stories that take place during the holiday season; all display her deft rendering of family relationships and the stresses of contemporary life. Unfortunately, however, these tales are formulaic and superficial. We meet women unable to spend Christmas with their married men, children from broken homes, aged parents for whom Christmas is an ordeal rather than a pleasure, couples trying to resolve the past, lonely souls looking for a future. Several stories feature second wives whose husbands are oblivious to the machinations of their (always beautiful but selfish) first spouses. While the characters and their predicaments are potentially interesting, as soon as her narratives begin to develop, Binchy catapults forward to disappointingly simplistic endings. Readers will yearn for more: more character development, more detail, less fast-forwarding, fewer perky or maudlin conclusions. These tales are fine for a fast read during a busy season, but many will wish that Binchy had instead developed one of them into a novel that would do justice to her characters and themes. (Nov.)",

    "synopsis": "<i>Crow Lake</i> is that rare find, a first novel so quietly assured, so emotionally pitch perfect, you know from the opening page that this is the real thing–a literary experience in which to lose yourself, by an author of immense talent.<br>\nHere is a gorgeous, slow-burning story set in the rural “badlands” of northern Ontario, where heartbreak and hardship are mirrored in the landscape. For the farming Pye family, life is a Greek tragedy where the sins of the fathers are visited on the sons, and terrible events occur–offstage. <br>\nCenterstage are the Morrisons, whose tragedy looks more immediate if less brutal, but is, in reality, insidious and divisive. Orphaned young, Kate Morrison was her older brother Matt’s protegee, her fascination for pond life fed by his passionate interest in the natural world. Now a zoologist, she can identify organisms under a microscope but seems blind to the state of her own emotional life. And she thinks she’s outgrown her siblings–Luke, Matt, and Bo–who were once her entire world. <br>\nIn this universal drama of family love and misunderstandings, of resentments harbored and driven underground, Lawson ratchets up the tension with heartbreaking humor and consummate control, continually overturning one’s expectations right to the very end. Tragic, funny, unforgettable, <i>Crow Lake</i> is a quiet tour de force that will catapult Mary Lawson to the forefront of fiction writers today.<br>\n<i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>\nAuthor Biography: Mary Lawson was born and brought up in a farming community in Ontario. After graduating from McGill University she went to England for a holiday and stayed on; she lives there still, with her husband and sons, though she returns to Canada every year.<br>\n<i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

    "synopsis": "Love. Violence. Destiny. These powerful themes ricochet through Lorenzo Carcaterra's new novel like bullets from a machine gun. In Gangster, he surpasses even his bestselling Sleepers to create a brutal and brilliant American saga of murder, forgiveness, and redemption.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>\"I was now well-prepared to be a career criminal... I just didn't have the stomach for any of it.\" Carcaterra's latest crime novel is the tantalizing coming-of-age story of orphan Gabe, groomed by longtime New York City mob boss Angelo Vestieri to be his successor. The novel opens in the 1990s as Gabe, now middle-aged, keeps watch over Vestieri on his hospital deathbed. Slipping back in time to the Depression, the narrative tracks the rise of the famed mob boss from Italian immigrant to lord of Manhattan's underworld, when Gabe, 10, walks into Vestieri's bar after running out on his latest foster parents in 1964. Vestieri takes the impressionable boy under his wing and ushers him into the world of organized crime. Gabe runs numbers, collects debts and learns loyalty and the price of betrayal. Yet when the time comes for Gabe to take over the operation, he refuses, choosing a normal life despite his deep love for Vestieri. As he did in Sleepers and Apaches, Carcaterra shows dexterity in humanizing the denizens of the urban underbelly. Through a fine characterization of the enigmatic Vestieri, he provides a stirring perspective on the ways of mobsters and their history. Yet the book's central theme, the complex choice facing Gabe, is poorly developed, rarely penetrating the surface of his rejection of gang life. Carcaterra's portrayal focuses primarily on violence as the source of Gabe's revulsion, only touching on Gabe's understanding of how mobsters--through fear and corruption--influence society in much deeper ways. (Feb. 1) Forecast: From its bold title and catchy cover to the publisher's plans for major ad/promo, including a six-city author tour, this novel promises to perform. Its major push, though, will come down the road, from a four-hour ABC miniseries already in the works. Copyright 2000 Cahners Business Information.",

Peter Wiley, once the town's high school football star, and his ex-prom queen wife, Sandra, are about to be dispossessed by the bank. There seems to be no hope for them and their children, Will and Andromeda. Until, that is, they hear the story of a little girl who has fallen down an abandoned mine shaft and whose dreadful plight incites Americans to respond with their prayers - and their pocketbooks. Maybe, the Wileys scheme, it could work for them, too. In <i>A Small Dark Place</i>, an act born of desperation, greed, and obsession takes on unforeseen and unforeseeable consequences for the Wileys and Wishbone.",

    "synopsis": "<P><b>The Onion</b> has quickly become the world's most popular humor publication, misinforming half a million readers a week with one-of-a-kind social satire both in print (on newsstands nationwide) and online from its remote office in Madison, Wisconsin.<P>Witness the march of history as Editor-in-Chief Scott Dikkers and <b>The Onion's</b> award-winning writing staff present the twentieth century like you've never seen it before. <h3>Salon - Liesl Schillinger</h3> <P>Nobody loves the last word more than a newsman -- and now that the 20th century is in its final stretch, the green-shade jockeys are neck and neck in the sum-up-the-century steeplechase. Walter Cronkite, Ben Bradlee and David Brinkley leapt in early with their books, and last year Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings and Harold Evans made impressive late entries. This month, though, Scott Dikkers and his madcap crew of angry young hacks at the <i>Onion</i>, the satirical weekly paper and Web site based in Madison, Wis., have sent the competition to the glue factory with their definitively victorious wrap-up, <i>Our Dumb Century</i>. Other reporters may have given the century a solemn salute, but the <i>Onion</i>'s staff has given it a resounding Bronx cheer, and early sales show that the public heartily approves of their assessment. <P>It is an unimaginably gloat-worthy luxury for a humorist to invade the virgin territory of American news coverage in the pre-irony era, and Dikkers and his henchmen make no attempt to muffle their glee. In a year-by-year parade of phony front pages, the editors goose-step through the 20th century, snickering at catastrophes, making hay of the news and booting one another in the rear along the way. The new century dawns with progress-drunk headlines blaring \"Nation's Skies Filled with Beautiful Black Smoke,\" while the birth of the bomb 40-odd years later prompts the blithe, whistling denial \"Nothing Going on in New Mexico: Top Physicists 'Just Camping.'\" By the time the television age has hit full flicker, no topic is off-limits -- from breasts (\"President Calls for Calm Following Nipple Sighting on Farrah Fawcett Poster\") to shootings (\"Hinckley, Foster to Wed: Actress 'Very Impressed' by Lone-Nut Gunman's Attempt on President's Life\") to air disasters (\"Schoolteacher, Kitten, Three Dozen Orphans to Fly on Challenger Tomorrow\"). <P>As the book careers through the decades, no subject, however grave, however innocent, is left unstrafed. World War II offers the occasion for \"Hitler Neutralizes Polish Menace\" and \"Belgium Hides.\" Later wars in Southeast Asia provide such notable gasps as \"Cambodia to Switch to Skull-Based Economy\" and \"U.S. Troops Pull Out of Vietnamese Peasant Girl.\" The shockfest winds up with signs that the \"swell years\" have long since gone and a cynical American populace has come to expect political scandal, nuclear fallout, lubricious mothers and despoiled nature -- even if the president who will lead us all into our next dumb century, Bill Clinton, vows that he \"Feels Nation's Pain, Breasts.\" <P>\"It's actually hard to write satire now,\" the <i>Onion</i> editors have said, \"... because the news is already a parody of itself.\" On the last front page in <i>Our Dumb Century</i>, the <i>Onion</i> reports the scoop that will make headlines on January 1, 2000 -- the day all the people who have stashed cash under their beds will take up arms against all the paupers with digital bank accounts: \"Christian Right Ascends to Heaven.\" Heaven, one can only hope, will not be much like home -- or, at least, not much like any home in this dumb century.",

    "synopsis": "<P>Set in 1935 England, this New York Times bestseller is enthralling in its depiction of childhood, love and war, England and class, making it a profound&#151;and profoundly moving&#151;exploration of shame and forgiveness, of atonement and the difficulty of absolution. Abridged. 5 CDs.<h3>Book Magazine</h3>On an English country estate in the jittery, gilded era between the two great wars, two young people stand in the summer's heat, arguing by an ancient fountain. Cecilia is the daughter of the household, and Robbie is the cleaning woman's son, a brilliant boy whose Cambridge education has been benevolently financed by Cecilia's father. During their quarrel, the two manage to break a valuable porcelain vase, and in a fury largely engendered by her unacknowledged feelings for the young man, Cecilia strips off her clothes, leaps into the fountain and retrieves the fragments. It is a dazzling moment, full of beauty and ruin, lust and innocence, so highly charged that it's no wonder Cecilia's little sister, Briony, observing unseen from a window, feels a sense of menace. She concludes that Robbie has compelled her sister to do something shameful. This assumption, when combined with later events, brings disaster not simply to the two young people who are discovering themselves to be lovers, but to everyone else in the well-intentioned, prosperous family. <BR> <BR> This is a crucial scene in the latest, luminous novel by Ian McEwan. As happens often with poetry, but much more rarely with novels, the book creates a curiously satisfying conflict of emotions. The pain and chaos of events are leavened by the delight of technical mastery. There is pleasure in having even our sorrows named with such precision. Sentences turn on a dime, or rather on an unexpected adjective, as when a litigious couple is described as defending their good names with a most expensive ferocity. <BR> <BR> Consider the description of the room of twelve-year-old Briony. In a slovenly household, it is an oasis of tidiness. Ona broad windowsill is set out a treasured model farm, consisting of the usual animals, but all facing one way&mdash;towards their owner&mdash;as if about to break into song. The attentive air of this little army of animals perfectly catches the vanity of childhood, when it seems only proper and desirable to have universal attention focused on oneself. <BR> <BR> The little barnyard world so neatly deployed is also emblematic of the slightly bigger world of the Tallis' estate, which has both the pleasing quality of a miniature and an innocent vanity, a smugness in the contentment so shortly to be swept away. McEwan is well aware of this, as when he describes the way Briony perceives that writing stories not only involved secrecy, it also gave her all the pleasures of miniaturisation. A world could be made in five pages, and one that was more pleasing than a model farm. <BR> <BR> What lies beyond that safe, well-controlled realm shows up in the novel's second half. Just as the first portion of the novel begins with the emblematic breaking of the vase, the second commences with a hallucinatory image of a child's smooth, severed leg caught in the branches of a tree. Robbie, enrolled as a private in the British Army, bears witness to such atrocities. In France during World War II, he participates in the hasty retreat that culminates with the evacuation at Dunkirk. Cecilia, a nurse in a veterans hospital in London, is coping with a parallel universe of brutality and absurdity, rigor and privation. <BR> <BR> This latest work by McEwan is no less intricate than 1987's <I>The Child in Time</I> and 1998's <I>Amsterdam</I>, two of his previous eight novels that won the Whitbread Prize and the Booker Prize, respectively. In sensibility the world of <I>Atonement</I> is achingly reminiscent of that created by Richard Hughes in his classic novels, <I>A High Wind in Jamaica</I> and <I>The Fox in the Attic</I>. There is the same sharply detailed delight in life and the same dismaying awareness of how easily the treasures of normalcy can be lost. In both men's work, there is a grave acknowledgment that a child's moral sense and judgment are vastly different from an adult's&mdash;and that the consequences of this difference can be enormous. But Hughes, writing fifty years ago, made no sign that he, or his narrator, was aware of the reader's steady gaze. McEwan offers an additional challenge. He makes us ache for the young lovers to be reunited, and Briony&mdash;whom we discover is the narrator&mdash; seems to grant our wish. But does she? <BR> <BR> The novel closes with an event postponed for sixty years. As in life, recurrence and familiar places give the narrator a sort of yardstick to gauge the changes in herself. Meanwhile, readers following a story over decades arrive at an apparent conclusion, then see the conclusion neatly undone, all the shining details exposed as invention, all replaced with circumstantial evidence. Clarity has bred not certainty but a sudden, rueful awareness of our own expectations, and of our nature as revealed in what we hope for.<BR> &#151;Penelope Mesic <BR>",

Desde la fundaci&oacute;n de un peque&ntilde;o asentamiento celta a los bombardeos de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, pasando por la invasi&oacute;n por parte de las legiones de C&eacute;sar en el a&ntilde;o 54 a.D, las Cruzadas, la conquista normanda, la creaci&oacute;n del teatro Globe en el que Shakespeare estrenar&iacute;a sus obras, las tensiones religiosas, el Gran Incendio, la &eacute;poca victoriana... cientos de historias mezclan a personajes realies y ficticios, perteneientes a unas pocas sagas familiares que se perpet&uacute;an a trav&eacute;s de los siglos. Cada episorio de London, profuso en detalles hist&oacute;ricos, revela la riqueza, la pasi&oacute;n, el br&iacute;o y la lucha por sobrevivir de una ciudad &uacute;nica.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>Like his aesthetic mentor, James Michener, Rutherfurd (Russka; Sarum) takes readers from primordial days to the present; here he focuses on the last 2000 years of humanity on the island kingdom as manifested through the fortunes of seven families and one ancient, ever-evolving city. Such chapter headings as \"The Tower,\" \"Hampton Court\" and \"The Globe\" reveal Rutherfurd's primary techniqueto create verbal dioramas that, alas, too often feel as static and didactic as museum displays. Rutherfurd lavishes his greatest attention on the minor figures in English history rather than the greats. Instead of Shakespeare there is Edmund Meredith, playwright of the middling The Blackamoor; instead of Christopher Wren, there is a cowardly, anti-papist woodcarver; and there is Isaac Fleming, creator of the wedding cake. Due to the sheer scope of Rutherfurd's vision, many signal events, such as the Black Death, are afforded only a glancing nod, while the first and final chapters read more like a mannerly BBC documentary than a proper setup for a legend on a grand scale. Rutherfurd's workmanlike narrative ultimately buckles under the weight of its own vast scale, yet readers will savor individual tidbits like the snapshot of young Geoffrey Chaucer saving an abandoned baby. Readers with imagination may even come away with the sense that great cities aren't just places but living beings with hearts and souls.

Gew writers evoke the complexities of love as subtly, and few capture the poignancy of the sudden insight or the rhythms of ordinary conversation with such delicacy and humor. To read these twelve stories&#151;of love and loss, of families and strangers, of small moments and enormous epiphanies&#151;is to be reminded again of the power of short fiction to thrill and move us, to make us laugh, or cry. In these profound glimpses into the private fears, joys, and sorrows of people we know, we find revealed a whole range of human experience, told with extraordinary force, clarity, and compassion.<h3>Richmond Times-Dispatch</h3>Some writers seem to have an instinctive sensitivity to human emotion. They seem to be able to reach inside human experience, responding to its variety instead of its limitations, and they have the rarest of abilities to record the nuances of this experience to create literature. Richard Bausch...is one of those rare mater writers, and his power continues to grow.",

The 1997-98 Campaign Started Innocently Enough. One Saturday In August, A Simple Pickup Game Turned Into A Amazing Display Of Basketball Brilliance - Freshmen Against Established Players, And With Barely A Shot Missed By Either Side. Suddenly Pat Summitt Glimpsed The Future: Fast, Aggressive, And Hugely Talented, This Might Be The Team She'd Worked Her Whole Career To Coach. As 1997 Turned Into 1998, Pat Summitt Began Privately To Admit To Herself That This Team Had Changed Her: These Kids Were So Lovable, Funny, And Eager To Please That She Simply Had To Let Them Into Her Heart. Along The Way, The Lady Vols Were Redefining What Young Women Were Capable Of, Trading In Old Definitions Of Femininity For New Ones - In Short, They Were Keeping Score. And By The Time They Entered The Ncaa Final Four Tournament In Kansas City, Summitt Found Herself Believing The Impossible: Despite All The Distractions, The 1997-98 Lady Vols Could Go Undefeated, And, In Doing So, Raise The Roof Off The Sport Of Women's Basketball.--jacket.

    "synopsis": "Belonging in the two Berlins is an ethnographic investigation into the meaning of German selfhood during the Cold War. Taking the practices of everyday life in the divided Berlin as his point of departure, Borneman shows how ideas of kin, state, and nation were constructed through processes of mirror-imaging and misrecognition. Using linguistics and narrative analysis, he compares the autobiographies of two generations of Berlins residents with the official version of the lifecourse prescribed by the two German states. He examines the relation of the dual political structure to everyday life, the way in which the two states legally regulated the lifecourse in order to define the particular categories of self which signify Germanness, and how citizens experientially appropriated the frameworks provided by these states. Living in the two Berlins constantly compelled residents to define themselves in opposition to their other half. Borneman argues that this resulted in a de facto divided Germany with two distinct nations and peoples. The formation of German subjectivity since World War II is unique in that the distinctive features for belonging - for being at home - to one side exclude the other. Indeed, these divisions inscribed by the Cold War account for many of the problems in forging a new cultural unity.",

    "synopsis": "Diane Johnson, two-time finalist for both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award, a noted observer of our times, has written a sparkling contemporary novel on Americans abroad that is hilariously insightful.When California girl Isabel Walker, film school dropout, comes to visit her stepsister Roxy in Paris, she arrives on the day that Roxy's French husband, Charles-Henri de Persand, has left her for another woman. Roxy is distraught and pregnant. Charles-Henri's powerful and prestigious French family is counseling patience and acceptance, Isabel is soon caught up in the romantic intrigue: and Roxy's parents are just as soon on their way to France to lend their daughter support. Add to all of this a contretemps over a painting belonging to the Walkers but given by Roxy as a wedding gift to her husband, which turns out to be extremely valuable. It is, as the French say, a situation.It is also the basis for a comedy of manners that looks with delicious wit at cultures and carnal desires in collision; at the absurd way in which love can lead us toward grand tragedy or, at least, toward jealous crimes of the heart. <I>Le Divorce</I>is a literary French treat, served with exquisite prose, superb plotting and much fun.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>It's no accident that the epigraph for this delightfully urbane social tragicomedy is taken from Henry James. Narrator Isabel Walker is a latter-day Isabel Archer, a charming, intelligent but nave American in Paris, who thinks herself sophisticated and analytical until her eyes are opened during the ironic, erotic and shocking events in the course of which she comes of age. Restless and unfocused, a drop-out from film school at Berkeley, Isabel is sent to Paris to help her pregnant step-sister, Roxy, through a difficult time: Roxy's husband, Charles-Henri Persand, has left her and their toddler daughter to run off with another woman. Isabel accepts a motley range of jobs in the American expatriate community-running errands, helping a famous writer with her files, serving at parties, etc.-and becomes aware of the jealousy and backbiting among the insular set. At first totally at sea because of the language barrier, she also gradually becomes aware that a chasm of misunderstandings and basic attitudinal differences lies beneath the cordial facade of Franco-American relationships. Meanwhile, an heirloom painting that Roxy brought to Paris is suddenly discovered to be an immensely valuable La Tour; under French law, it will be considered part of the divorce settlement. The tangled provenance of this painting creates tensions among the Walker family's half-siblings. The wealthy and powerful Persand family are also beset by a series of emotional involvements, including Isabel's own clandestine relationship with Charles-Henri's elderly uncle, a charming rou and political minence grise. By the time the various strands of the plot culminate in surreal scenes at EuroDisney and the poubelles (refuse bins) of Roxy's apartment building, Isabel has become wiser about herself and the world, though she realizes that her point of view will always be colored by her Californian mindset. Johnson's (Persian Nights) control of her material is impeccable. The world of American expatriates is fertile territory for her ironic wit, which is both subtle and sharp. Everything here delights the reader: the sinuous plot with its rising suspense; the charged insights into family dynamics; the reflections on morality as perceived on both sides of the Atlantic; the witty asides on food, politics and sibling rivalry; the dialogue, which reflects both American and French speech patterns and social conventions; and the views of Paris itself, seen through the eyes of an ingenue who grows in sophistication as she begins to understand the reality that permeates this city of romance.

    "synopsis": "<P>Here is the first book in the blockbuster trilogy that chronicles the never-before-told story of the young Han Solo. Set before the Star Wars movie adventures, these books chronicle the coming-of-age of the galaxy's most famous con man, smuggler, and thief.<br><br>The first book in this exciting new Han Solo series begins with a recounting of Han's late teen years and shows us how he escaped an unhappy adopted home situation to carve out an adventurous new life for himself as a pilot. Han Solo, the handsome rogue, is every girl's dream man, and every boy's hero. <b>The Paradise Snare</b> is another stellar Star Wars production, complete with original music and sound effect<h3>VOYA</h3>Veteran science fiction author Crispin has produced a trilogy about the slightly shady smuggler and con man Han Solo that is perfect for the legions of fans of the movies and their spin-offs. The books should be read in order as a unit. In the first novel, Han Solo is \"rescued\" from the slums of Corellia to serve in Garris Shrike's roving band of space criminals. Han escapes Shrike's brutal rule only to take a pilot's job serving the grotesque t'landa Til and their overlords, the Hutts, on the slave planet Ylesia. How Han and his new friends, Bria and Muuurgh, outsmart the Hutts and escape from Ylesia with a fortune makes for an exciting and fast-paced story. The second volume of the trilogy opens with Han's life in a shambles. Not only has he been kicked out of the Imperial Navy for saving the life of a slave, the ex-slave-a huge, hairy Wookiee-has attached himself to Han to whom he now owes a \"life debt.\" When the still resentful Hutts set bounty hunter Boba Fett on his trail, however, Han will be grateful for the friendship of the gigantic alien. In the concluding book of the trilogy, Han has just won Lando Calrissian's speedy Millennium Falcon in a game of sabacc. He and Chewie are now the best of all the smugglers, even though the Empire and the mysterious Darth Vader are growing threats. A sure opportunity at enormous wealth and the reappearance of an ex-girlfriend and her group of Rebel insurgents result in Han and Chewie penniless and wanted throughout the galaxy. The novel concludes as Han and Chewie, broke and with prices on their heads, contract a charter night for an \"old guy in the Jawa robe, and the kid in a moisture farmer's outfit.\" Readers who love good space opera and Star Wars will devour this trilogy the way the Hutts devour nala-tree frogs.

    "synopsis": "<P>Extravagant, inventive, emotionally sweeping, <b>Corelli's Mandolin</b> is the story of a timeless place that one day wakes up to find itself in the jaws of history.&#160;&#160;The place is the Greek island of Cephallonia, where gods once dabbled in the affairs of men and the local saint periodically rises from his sarcophagus to cure the mad.&#160;&#160;Then the tide of World War II rolls onto the island's shores in the form of the conquering Italian army.<P>Caught in the occupation are Pelagia, a willful, beautiful young woman, and the two suitors vying for her love&#58;&#160;&#160;Mandras, a gentle fisherman turned ruthless guerilla, and the charming, mandolin-playing Captain Corelli, a reluctant officer of the Italian garrison on the island.&#160;&#160;Rich with loyalties and betrayals, and set against a landscape where the factual blends seamlessly with the fantastic, <b>Corelli's Mandolin</b> is a passionate novel as rich in ideas as it is genuinely moving.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>This dark yet dazzling tour de force invigorates the genre of antiwar comedies in the style of Hasek, Heller and Vonnegut. Bernieres sweeps across a 50 year history of a glorious Greek Island at peace and at war and simultaneously homes in on its panoply of major and minor characters and the Italians forced by Mussolini to invade them. The fusion of Greek and Christian mythologies in Cephalonia makes for rollicking scenes such as the Feast of St. Gerasimos, with its miracle cures and drunken stupors. The barbaric, paranoid absurdity of Mussolini and his ill-prepared, ill-led and unwilling army makes both for high comedy and blood curdling scenes of starvation, misery and death. The humanizing role of the arts, musical and medical, informs it all. Because Berniers's farce and fury erupt through a witty word play carefully tone shifts, listening to this novel is, in some ways, even better than reading it. Lang fearlessly carries listeners through swiftly changing currents of tenderness and horror, kindness and cruelty. With his fine array of Greek, Italian and British accents, he masterfully reveals the soaring emotional range across and within characters. Even the lengthy tirades of fascist dictators and communist dogmatists are rendered with passionate, painful and refreshing irony. Based on the 1994 Pantheon hardcover. (Jan.)

    "synopsis": "In this amazingly imaginative tale, literary figures from throughout time and various bodies of work are brought together to face any and all threats to Britain. Allan Quartermain, Mina Murray, Captain Nemo, Dr. Henry Jekyll and Edward Hyde and Hawley Griffin, the Invisible Man, form a remarkable legion of intellectual aptitude and physical prowess. Presented in this trade paperback is the League's first adventure together, from their initial recruitment to their heroic victory. Also included in this volume is the illustrator's masterful sketchbook, which gives unique behind-the-scenes insight to the artistic process.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>Acclaimed comics author Moore (Watchmen) has combined his love of 19th-century adventure literature with an imaginative mastery of its 20th-century corollary, the superhero comic book. This delightful work features a grand collection of signature 19th-century fictional adventurers, covertly brought together to defend the empire. The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen comprises such characters as Minna Murray (formerly Harker), from Bram Stoker's Dracula; Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll (and his monstrous alter ego, Mr. Hyde); and Jules Verne's Captain Nemo, restored to the dark, grim-visaged Sikh Verne originally intended. There's also Hawley Griffin, the imperceptible hero of H.G. Well's The Invisible Man, and Allan Quartermain, the daring adventurer of King Solomon's Mines and other classic yarns by H. Rider Haggard. It's 1898, and these troubled adventurers are spread around the globe, in the midst of one pickle or another. Quartermain is found near death, delirious in a Cairo opium den; the perverse Griffin is captured terrorizing an all-girls school (leaving behind a series of mysterious pregnancies); and the gruesome Mr. Hyde is rescued from the mob set to kill him at the end of Stevenson's classic novel. This collection of flawed and gloomy heroes is recruited to fight a criminal mastermind (a notorious 19th-century literary villain) intent on firebombing the East End of London. The book also includes Allan and the Sundered Veil, a rip-snorting, prose time-travel story starring Quartermain and written in the manner of the 19th-century penny dreadful. Moore and O'Neill have created a Victorian era Fantastic Four, a beautifully illustrated reprise of 19th-century literary derring-do packed with period detail, great humor and rousing adventure.

    "synopsis": "Pirates have become so much a part of story and legend that is easy to forget they actually existed in the flesh. Their roving lives left behind little in the way of historical record; thus our image of them is derived from a smattering of fact overlaid with three centuries of ballads, plays, epic poems, and films. But how does our conception of pirates compare with the reality, and why has such a romantic aura become associated with murderers and thieves? Pursuing that question, Dr. David Cordingly, former head of exhibitions at England's National Maritime Museum, has mined a wealth of original sources - eyewitness accounts, court documents, national archives, and more - to create the most authoritative and definitive account of the great age of piracy since the 1724 bestseller The General History of the Robberies and Murders of the most notorious Pyrates. Under the Black Flag explodes many closely held myths and replaces them with a truth that is more complex and every bit as fascinating. Here are the real stories of Blackbeard, Captain Kidd, and Henry Morgan, along with lesser-known but equally noteworthy pirates such as Henry Avery (who captured an emperor's treasure fleet but died penniless) and the cross-dressing women Anne Bonny and Mary Read. From the havoc of battle to the isolation of life at sea, Under the Black Flag makes tangible the day-to-day existence of pirates. How they attacked, how they governed themselves, what they wore, what ships they used, why they flourished in the years around 1720, and what brought their reign of terror to an end - all is revealed in this rousing and revisionist history.\n\n                        For this rousing, revisionist history, the former head of exhibitions at England's National Maritime Museum has combed original documents and records to produce a most authoritative and definitive account of piracy's \"Golden Age.\" As he explodes many accepted myths (i.e. \"walking the plank\" is pure fiction), Cordingly replaces them with a truth that is more complex and often bloodier. of photos.

Selina was imprisoned after a séance she was conducting went horribly awry, leaving an elderly matron dead and a young woman deeply disturbed.

    "synopsis": "In this stunning book, the first comprehensive biography of Marx since the end of the Cold War, Francis Wheen gives us not a socialist ogre but a fascinating, ultimately humane man, while still examining the criticisms of his detractors. A study in contradictions, Karl Marx was at once a reserved scholar, a fiery agitator, and a gregarious socialite, while his intellect and ideology were once described as \"Rousseau, Voltaire, and Hegel fused into one person.\" He lived both at the center and on the fringes of his age, and his oratory and writing continue to change the contemporary world. In his entertaining, offbeat style, Wheen offers an eminently readable biography of one of history's most unforgettable figures. \"Wheen's portrait of Marx's life is artfully shaped and makes delectable reading.\"—<em>New York Times</em> \"A magnificent portrait of Marx.... Bravo!\"—A. N. Wilson \"[E]xpertly researched, admirably objective, eminently humane, and plenty entertaining.\"—<em>Boston Book Review</em>",

    "synopsis": "<P>The establishment of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission was a pioneering international event. Never had any country sought to move forward from despotism to democracy both by exposing the atrocities committed in the past and achieving reconciliation with its former oppressors. At the center of this unprecedented attempt at healing a nation has been Archbishop Desmond Tutu, whom President Nelson Mandela named as Chairman of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. With the final report of the Commission just published, Archbishop Tutu offers his reflections on the profound wisdom he has gained by helping usher South Africa through this painful experience.<P>In <b>No Future Without Forgiveness</b>, Tutu argues that true reconciliation cannot be achieved by denying the past.&#160;&#160;But nor is it easy to reconcile when a nation &quot;looks the beast in the eye.&quot; Rather than repeat platitudes about forgiveness, he presents a bold spirituality that recognizes the horrors people can inflict upon one another, and yet retains a sense of idealism about reconciliation. With a clarity of pitch born out of decades of experience, Tutu shows readers how to move forward with honesty and compassion to build a newer and more humane world. <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> This insightful book about South Africa's healing process is no simple feel-good tale. In 1995, Tutu was looking forward to a well-earned retirement from his role as Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town. He had given his life to the antiapartheid struggle and had spoken the truth to those in power so many times that, in 1984, he received the Nobel Peace Prize. Still, in 1996, President Mandela and others prevailed upon him to postpone retirement's pleasures to give South Africa one more thing: his leadership as chairman of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Tutu speaks frankly of this call, of the struggle that preceded it and of the betrayals and jubilations of this unique commission. The TRC's work was unprecedented not only in its emphasis on restorative over retributive justice but in the spirituality that permeated its work, the bulk of which constituted hearings from the \"victims\" and \"perpetrators\" of apartheid. Ubuntu, Tutu explains, is the African expression that was at the heart of the TRC's labors. Meaning something like \"a person is a person through other people,\" ubuntu sums up Tutu's philosophical framework for addressing apartheid's hard truths and beginning the reconciliation process necessary to move beyond apartheid's legacy. Despite the occasional factual inconsistency and some clich s (the book seems hastily written), Tutu's wisdom and experience come through. Human rights, he affirms, cannot stand without ubuntu's deeper foundation; the future cannot be without forgiveness. (Oct.) Copyright 1999 Cahners Business Information.",

Told in language of great simplicity and power, it is the story of an old Cuban fisherman, down on his luck, and his supreme ordeal — a relentless, agonizing battle with a giant marlin far out in the Gulf Stream. Here Hemingway recasts, in strikingly contemporary style, the classic theme of courage in the face of defeat, of personal triumph won from loss. Written in 1952, this hugely successful novella confirmed his power and presence in the literary world and played a large part in his winning the 1954 Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\n                        An old Cuban fisherman triumphs over a giant marlin--only to have his prized catch literally eaten away by circling sharks.\n",

These two amazing women don't regard the single life as a cross to bear, but rather an amazing opportunity to take advantage of all life has to offer and to discover their God-ordained purpose. While acknowledging the pitfalls singles sometimes face, they celebrate the advantages that also come with singleness and validate it as a true gift from God. Tackling topics such as lust, loneliness, discouragement, and bitterness, the authors use humor and sound biblical teaching as a point of reference. Unique features include a \"Dating 101\" section, a Q&A format on hot topics, and an open, honest dialogue between the two authors. ",

Combining clear-eyed insight into the machinations of politicians and economists who struggled to revive the battered economy, personal stories from the average people who were hardest hit by an economic crisis beyond their control, and an evocative depiction of the popular culture of the decade, McElvaine paints an epic picture of an America brought to its knees—but also brought together by people’s widely shared plight.<br>\n &nbsp;<br>\n In a new introduction, McElvaine draws striking parallels between the roots of the Great Depression and the economic meltdown that followed in the wake of the credit crisis of 2008. He also examines the resurgence of anti-regulation free market ideology, beginning in the Reagan era, and argues that some economists and politicians revised history and ignored the lessons of the Depression era.\n\n\n                        Repackaged to tie-in to a forthcoming PBS series on the Great Depression scheduled to air in October, this perennially popular work is fully revised to include new scholarship published over the last eight years. One of the country's premier scholars on the subject, McElvaine is consulting historian to the PBS documentary. Photos throughout.\n",

So when a KEY News colleague dies with symptoms terrifyingly similar to those of anthrax, she knows the panic spreading through the corridors of the Broadcast Center is justified. <P><b>And No One Is Safe...</b>As one death follows another, Annabelle's co-workers look to her for assurance, but she finds it hard to give comfort. To her, the circumstances surrounding the infections suggest diabolical murders. <P><b>There's Nowhere To Run.</b>And when the authorities lock down the Broadcast Center with the identity of the killer still unknown, neither the victims nor the murderer can escape...<P><b>\"The dexterity in keeping so many guilty-looking characters afloat at once and the revelation of a truly surprising killer make Clark's sixth dispatch from KEY News her best.\" -<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><b> </b><b>\"Clark has perfected the suspense novel, where in classic Christie fashion, everyone is a potential suspect...timely, and downright fun.\" -<i>Booklist</i></b><P><b>\"A fast-paced story line...a winner. Readers will appreciate this strong whodunit.\" -<i>Midwest Book Reviews</i></b><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>CBS veteran Clark (Nobody Knows) brings a network news producer's sensibility to the story of a newsroom in the throes of anthrax-induced pandemonium. In quick chapters that jump-cut among numerous points of view, Clark narrates a nerve-racking week in the life of KEY News producer Annabelle Murphy. When Annabelle's medical correspondent, Dr. John Lee, holds up what he says is a vial of weapons-grade anthrax on morning TV, panic ensues: executives call management meetings, security agents peer into spy cameras, the FBI snoops around and doctors dispense Cipro. Lee's anthrax proves to be table sugar-but then Annabelle's colleague Jerome Henning, who's quietly been writing a nasty tell-all, lands in the hospital and quickly succumbs to the disease. A food-service worker is murdered next, and another person is found dead. Annabelle frets about Jerome's manuscript and tries to figure out what's going on, all the while unwittingly carrying anthrax spores in her coat pocket. Who needs terrorists when there are so many office villains around? There's the aging, control-freak male bigwig, the driven female executive, the insider-trading business reporter and the cocaine-sniffing theater reviewer, to name a few. Clark's spare prose depends on brisk dialogue and rapid-fire action sequences, and her stereotypical characters are pastiches of a few simple virtues, flaws and guilty secrets. Still, the yarn entertains with a little network gossip and a short lesson in bio-terror, all seen through the eyes of a network producer who starts out fearing for her job and ends up fearing for her life.

Determined to survive through her enduring faith in family unity, Adeline struggled for independence as she moved from Hong Kong to England and eventually to the United States to become a physician and writer.<P>A compelling, painful, and ultimately triumphant story of a girl's journey into adulthood, Adeline's story is a testament to the most basic of human needs&#58; acceptance, love, and understanding.

Meredith, Brandon, Greg, and Stephen quickly discover the fragile boundaries between friendship and betrayal as they enter high school and form new allegiances. Brandon and Greg gain popularity as football jocks and Meredith joins the bulimic in-crowd, while Stephen is treated as an outcast and is the target of homophobia. Then two violent deaths disrupt the core of what they once shared.  Five years later the friends are drawn back together and what was held to be a tragic accident is discovered to be murder. Other secrets begin to unravel and the casual cruelties of high school develop into acts of violence that threaten an entire city.<h3>(August 27, 2000) - Rocky Mountain News</h3>...an imaginative gothic tale...",

Shunning any re-creation, archival footage, or visual documentation of the events, filmmaker Claude Lanzmann relied on the words of witnesses—Jewish, Polish, and German—to describe in ruthless detail the bureaucratic machinery of the Final Solution, so that the remote experiences of the Holocaust became fresh and immediate. This book presents in an accessible and vivid format the testimony of survivors, participants, witnesses, and scholars. This tenth anniversary edition, published on the fiftieth anniversary of the liberation of the camps, is newly revised and corrected in order to more accurately present the actual testimony of those interviewed. <i>Shoah</i> is an unparalleled oral history of the Holocaust, an intensely readable journey through the twentieth century's greatest horror.\n\n                        The text of the film which re-creates the horror and truth of the Nazi extermination camps through interviews with the victims.\n",

    "synopsis": "<P><b>By the author of<i> Annie on My Mind</i></b><P>When Wilson High <i>Telegraph </i>editor Jamie Crawford writes an opinion piece in support of the new sex-ed curriculum, which includes making condoms available to high school students, she has no idea that a huge controversy is brewing. Lisa Buel, a school board member, is trying to get rid of the health program, which she considers morally flawed, from its textbooks to its recommendations for outside reading. The newspaper staff find themselves in the center of the storm, and things are complicated by the fact that Jamie is in the process of coming to terms with being gay, and her best friend, Terry, also gay, has fallen in love with a boy whose parents are anti-homosexual. As Jamie's and Terry's sexual orientation becomes more obvious to other studetns, it looks as if the paper they're fighting to keep alive and honest is going to be taken away from them. Nancy Garden has depicted a contemporary battleground in a novel that probes deep into issues of censorship, prejudice, and ethics.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>Issues, not characters, drive this story, a retread of the themes and setting in Garden's Good Moon Rising. Jamie Crawford, a senior, has achieved her goal of becoming editor-in-chief of her small New England high school's paper. She is also fairly sure she is gay, and when Tessa Gillespie, a new girl from Boston, shows up wearing a red cape and a star-shaped stud in her nose, Jamie starts falling in love. Tessa happens to be straight, but as it turns out, Jamie's unrequited love causes her less anguish than the rise to power of fundamentalist Mrs. Buel. A \"stealth candidate\" during her campaign for a seat on the school committee, Mrs. Buel leads the committee to set aside the new sex education curriculum and stages a book burning on Halloween. The liberal faculty adviser to the school paper is put on leave, and Jamie is forbidden to weigh in on controversial subjects in her editorials. While turning out the rah-rah paper the new faculty adviser insists on, Jamie and her staff eke out the time and energy to publish an underground paper. Another plot line concerns the outing of Jamie's best friend and the swim team star he is attracted to: lockers are defaced, and Jamie and her friends are nearly attacked in the cafeteria. Garden pays less attention to her characters' emotional lives than to their political passions. Unfortunately, if the characters don't seem real, their passions won't ignite readers. Ages 12-up.

    "synopsis": "<P>It takes a remarkable writer to make an old story as fresh and compelling as the first time we heard it. With <i>The Winter King, </i>the first volume of his magnificent Warlord Chronicles, Bernard Cornwell finally turns to the story he was born to write&#58; the mythic saga of King Arthur.<P>The tale begins in Dark Age Britain, a land where Arthur has been banished and Merlin has disappeared, where a child-king sits unprotected on the throne, where religion vies with magic for the souls of the people. It is to this desperate land that Arthur returns, a man at once utterly human and truly heroic&#58; a man of honor, loyalty, and amazing valor; a man who loves Guinevere more passionately than he should; a man whose life is at once tragic and triumphant. <P>As Arthur fights to keep a flicker of civilization alive in a barbaric world, Bernard Cornwell makes a familiar tale into a legend all over again.<h3>Library Journal</h3>The Arthurian legend has seen countless renditions over the centuries. The Winter King is a retelling that is reminiscent of Mary Stewart's \"Crystal Cave\" series (e.g., The Crystal Cave: The Legend of Merlin, Dove Audio, 1989). Characters are rearranged, resulting in a vain and unpopular Lancelot, an ambitious and scheming Guinevere, a Merlin who is more absent Druid than mystic magician, and a Mordred who is Uther's grandson and legitimate heir. The tale is told by the Saxon-born monk Derfel Cadarn for Igraine, a young queen. He relates his childhood in Merlin's compound, his years soldiering with Arthur, and the deeds he witnesses. This gritty tale is well read by Tim Pigott-Smith. Author Cornwell is perhaps best known for his Sharpe military fiction series. Recommended.Denise A. Garofalo, Mid-Hudson Lib.

    "synopsis": "Newly divorced surgeon Dr. Kim Regis is determined to remain a good father to his only son, Selden. On a special night out, Kim takes Seldon to his favorite fast-food restaurant for a feast of burgers and fries. But the good time turns to tragedy: the young boy becomes gravely ill and dies as a result of poisoning by <b>E. coli.</b> bacteria found in the meat. Was Seldon's death a result of shoddy food-handling practices? Or was it a sophisticated case of product tampering - by a rival fast-foot giant or a disgruntled employee? Or perhaps by someone with a score to settle with Kim? Taking a leave from his surgical practice, Kim devotes his energies to solving the mystery full time. But he immediately hits a brick walls: a code of silence more impenetrable than anything he has ever encountered in his medical career. Instead of a cold-shoulder reception, however, Kim is soon met with a boot and a fist as thugs attempt to quash his inquiry. Aided by his ex-wife, Kim pursues a trail of deadly evidence, uncovering complicity and guilt stretching from the slaughterhouse floor to the corporate boardroom. Racing against time before more are poisoned, the two come face-to-face with the shocking and elusive truth. And in their life-and-death search for answers, they rediscover the reasons they first fell in love. With trademark pulse-pounding flair, <b>Robin Cook</b> delivers a cutting-edge thriller, borrowing from today's fears and tomorrow's medical technology.",

    "synopsis": "<P>In my eyes she had always been old, always been mine, always been Granny Dan. But in another time, another place, there had been dancing, people, laughter, love. . . . She had had another life before she came to us, long before she came to me. . . . <br> <br> She was the cherished grandmother who sang songs in Russian, loved to roller-skate, and spoke little of her past. But when Granny Dan died, all that remained was a box wrapped in brown paper, tied with string. Inside, an old pair of satin toe shoes, a gold locket, and a stack of letters tied with ribbon. It was her legacy, her secret past, waiting to be discovered by the granddaughter who loved her but never really knew her. It was a story waiting to be told. . . . <br> <br> The year was 1902. A new century was dawning as a motherless young girl arrived at a ballet school in St. Petersburg, Russia, at the age of seven. By age seventeen, Danina Petroskova had become a great ballerina, a favorite of the Czar and Czarina, who welcomed her into the heart of the Imperial family. But events both near and far away shook the ground upon which she danced. A war, an extraordinary man, and a devastating illness altered the course of her life. And when revolution shattered Russia, Danina Petroskova was forced to make a heartbreaking choice&mdash;as the world around her was about to change forever.<br> <br> <b>Granny Dan</b> is about the magic of history. In it, Danielle Steel reminds us how little we know of those who came before us&mdash;and how, if we could only glimpse into their early lives, and see who they once were, there is so much we would understand and learn. For in this extraordinary novel, a simple box, filled with mementos from a grandmother, offers the greatest legacy of all&#58; an unexpected gift of a life transformed, a long-forgotten history of youth and beauty, love and dreams.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>In a fable compact enough to be swallowed in a single gulp, the prolific Steel (Bittersweet) offers a granddaughter's tribute to Danina Petroskova, \"Granny Dan,\" a Russian immigrant who left the glamorous world of the St. Petersburg Ballet and lived thereafter as a Vermont housewife. The unnamed narrator always loved her grandmother, with her elegant braided hair, roller skates and soft Russian accent. Granny Dan rarely speaks of her life in Russia before the revolution, but when she dies, at almost 90, the narrator inherits a pair of ballet shoes and a packet of love letters that tell the dramatic story of her former existence. Committed at age seven to the ballet, in her teens Danina becomes a prima ballerina who enchants the czar and czarina, becoming the royal children's boon companion. Stricken by influenza at 19, Danina's life is saved by Czarevitch Alexei's physician, Nikolai Obrajensky, with whom she falls passionately in love. This fairy tale is fully outfitted with dreamy details such as ermine-trimmed gowns, covered sleighs and royal balls in glittering palaces. The historical technicalities are glossed over: in this book the Russian czar is a nice man who let the revolution go too far because he wanted his people to express their feelings. The love story is pure melodrama, with Nikolai a princely man married to a \"dreadful Englishwoman,\" and the couple tormented by their unquenchable passions, lofty joys and ultimate tragedy. Steel doesn't unfold the plot so much as restate the same point: that Granny Dan led an extraordinary life of romance and heartbreak; this slim confection holds few surprises in telling the Cinderella story in reverse.

He finally settles in an abandoned schoolbus with Rose, a child he rescues from a fast-talking pedophile.

Each chapter of this unusual novel is prefaced with a recipe, but the recipes have more to do with romance than food. The dishes impart the intoxicating flavors of fantastic lust, grief, jealousy, and all the other passions that permeate this sensual love story. The heroine, Tita, is the youngest of three daughters. Practically raised in the kitchen, she is expected to spend her life waiting on Mama Elena and never to marry. Her habitual torment increases when her beloved Pedro becomes engaged to one of her sisters. Tita and he are thrown into tantalizing proximity and manage to communicate their affection through the dishes she prepares for him and his rapturous appreciation. Eventually, Tita's culinary wizardry unleashes uncontrollable forces, with surprising results. Fanciful, earthy, and sublime, this is a joy to read.",

    "synopsis": "From a skeleton, a skull, a mere fragment of burnt thighbone, Dr. William Maples can deduce the age, gender, and ethnicity of a murder victim, the manner in which the person was dispatched, and, ultimately, the identity of the killer.&#160;&#160;In <i>Dead Men Do Tell Tales</i>, Dr. Maples revisits his strangest, most interesting, and most horrific investigations, from the baffling cases of conquistador Francisco Pizarro and Vietnam MIAs to the mysterious deaths of President Zachary Taylor and the family of Czar Nicholas II. <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> Noted forensic anthropologist Maples, whose specialty is the study of bones, and freelance journalist Browning here recount Maples's criminal and anthropological investigations over the past 20 years. The meandering text combines episodes from Maples's personal life and education with discourses on his philosophy, his teaching at the Univ. of Florida and his work. The book's strength is as a snapshot of the world of forensic scientists, vividly portraying the siege mentality of many of them when their objective data are used for purposes other than ascertaining the truth about how a victim died. Despite the two-dimensional depiction of the people who were the objects of Maples's investigations-including the ``likely'' remains of Romanov Tsar Nicholas II-his memoirs should hold readers' interest.

This diary became the secret place where Ellen could confess her fears of the new marriage, her confusion over her emerging sexuality, and the nightmare that her life would become. The diary not only follows the development of a girl into womanhood, it follows the construction of the Rimbauer mansioncalled Rose Redan enormous home that would be the site of so many horrific and inexplicable tragedies in the years ahead.

Edited by Joyce Reardon, Ph.D. as part of her research, the diary is being published as preparations are being made by Dr. Reardon to enter Rose Red and fully investigate its disturbing history.",

It shows how poetry and practicality, far from being mutually exclusive, reinforce each other to give every aspect of our lives meaning and direction. For anyone who wants to deepen their connection to their life’s work—or find out what their life’s work is—this book can help navigate the way.\n Whyte encourages readers to take risks at work that will enhance their personal growth, and shows how burnout can actually be beneficial and used to renew professional interest. He asserts that too many people blindly trudge through a mediocre work life because so many “busy” tasks prevent significant reflection and analysis of job satisfaction. People often turn to spiritual practice or religion to nurture their souls, but overlook how work can actually be our greatest opportunity for discovery and growth. <b>Crossing the Unknown Sea</b> combines poetry, gifted storytelling and Whyte’s personal experience to reveal work’s potential to fulfill us and bring us closer to ultimate freedom and happiness.",

Rena's Promise, the remarkable story of her survival, shows how her relationship with her younger sister, Danka, gave her the will to persevere under unimaginable circumstances. \"Deeply moving.\" -Dena Taylor, San Francisco Chronicle  <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> Imagining that, by volunteering for a work camp, she would somehow be protecting her family from the Nazis, Rena, at age 17, put on her best clothes, left her fianc and the Polish village of Tylicz in the Carpathian Mountains and was sent off to Auschwitz. Presently, her sister Danka arrived, as did cousins, schoolmates and neighbors. As a child, she had promised her mother to look after her baby sister, and that promise obsessed her throughout her incarceration in the camp. It gave her reason to survive, so that one day she could bring Danka safely home. How they escaped starvation, beatings, the crematorium, the medical experiments of the notorious Josef Mengele and survived the end of the war is all recounted here in this spirited survivor's testament, written with freelancer Macadam. After the war, Rena married a Red Cross worker and emigrated to the U.S., following her sister. (Oct.)",

In 1993, historian Jacqueline Tobin met African American quilter Ozella Williams amid piles of beautiful handmade quilts in the Old Market Building of Charleston, South Carolina. With the admonition to &quot;write this down,&quot; Williams began to describe how slaves made coded quilts and used them to navigate their escape on the Underground Railroad. But just as quickly as she started, Williams stopped, informing Tobin that she would learn the rest when she was &quot;ready.&quot;&#160;&#160; During the three years it took for Williams's narrative to unfold--and as the friendship and trust between the two women grew--Tobin enlisted Raymond Dobard, Ph.D., an art history professor and well-known African American quilter, to help unravel the mystery.<br><br>Part adventure and part history, <b>Hidden in Plain View</b> traces the origin of the Charleston Code from Africa to the Carolinas, from the low-country island Gullah peoples to free blacks living in the cities of the North, and shows how three people from completely different backgrounds pieced together one amazing American story.",

    "synopsis": "<P>Jesse B. Simple, Simple to his fans, made weekly appearances beginning in 1943 in Langston Hughes' column in the Chicago Defender. Simple may have shared his readers feelings of loss and dispossession, but he also cheered them on with his wonderful wit and passion for life.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>Hughes (1902-1967), whose work accelerated the recognition of African American literature, is remembered mostly for his poetry. But Hughes also touched the minds of millions through the brief narrations of the fictional Jesse B. Semple, or ``Simple,'' which first appeared in 1943 in his column in the Chicago Defender and, later, in the New York Post. Here, edited by a teacher at Spelman College, is an enlightening collection of these social commentaries. Half of the selections have never appeared in book form; the others are drawn from five previous Simple collections, all out of print. Harper groups her choices into four sections: ``Women in Simple's Life''; ``Race, Riots, Police, Prices, and Politics''; ``Africa and Black Pride''; and ``Parting Lines.'' Topics range from criticism of superficial beauty (``Wigs, Women and Falsies'') to animal rights (``Money and Mice'') and the equation of the word ``black'' with ``evil'' in American slang (``That Word Black''). Throughout, the persistence of some issues from the 1940s through the present is striking and infuriating. In ``Population Explosion,'' for example, written in 1965, Simple criticizes the racist underpinnings of birth-control and sterilization proposals, while in ``Liberals Need a Mascot,'' from 1949, he takes an insightful jab at the hypocritical politically correct. Also discussing Pan Africanism, children's rights, socioeconomic imbalances and African American animosity toward the police, Hughes, through the sometimes hyperbolic but always critical commentary of Jesse B. Semple, challenges the widespread notion of the unsophisticated ``common man.'' Welcome back, Simple. (July)",

It seems as if some \"force\" is touching them all...\nThen an alien presence appears.

Since it remains invisible to computer sensors, some are calling it an illusion, others are calling it an evil life force. Still others are calling it God.

I want to say they showed up like the angel Gabriel appearing to the Virgin Mary, setting events in motion I could never have guessed.\" So begins the story of Lily Melissa Owens, a plucky girl, rich in humor despite heart wrenching circumstances. Living on a peach farm in South Carolina with her harsh, unyielding father, her entire life has been shaped around one devastating, though blurred, memory- the afternoon her mother was killed. Four at the time, she remembers innocently picking up the gun. And, she has her father's eyewitness account of the gun firing. People remind her it was an accident, yet she's inhabited by a torturous guilt. Lily's only real companion is Rosaleen, a tender, but fierce-hearted black woman who cooks, cleans and acts as her \"stand-in mother.\" <P>South Carolina in 1964 is a place and time of seething racial divides. When violence explodes one summer afternoon, and Rosaleen is arrested and beaten, Lily is desperate, not only to save Rosaleen, but to flee a life she can no longer endure. Calling upon her colorful wits and uncommon daring, she breaks Rosaleen out of jail and the two of them take off, runaway-fugitives conjoined in an escape that quickly turns into Lily's quest for the truth about her mother's life. <P>Following a trail left ten years earlier, Lily and Rosaleen end up in the home of three bee-keeping sisters. No ordinary women, the sisters revere a Black Madonna and tend a unique brand of female spirituality that reaches back to the time of slavery. As Lily's life becomes deeply entwined with theirs, she is irrevocably altered. In a mesmerizing world of bees and honey, amid the strength and power of wise women, Lily journeys through painful secrets and shattering betrayals, finding her way to the single thing her heart longs for most. <P>Learn more about Sue Monk Kidd at SueMonkKidd.com.<h3>Richmond Times-Dispatch</h3>...an Oprah pick just waiting to happen.",

It was partly in response to Dunnett's followers, a large group of avid readers who discussed her work on the Internet and bemoaned its unavailability, that Vintage set out to reintroduce the Lymond Chronicles to an American audience. Like Patrick O'Brian, whose books have attracted a devoted following, Dunnett's work is timeless, an extravagantly imagined blend of fact and fiction. Although Dunnett's hero, Francis Crawford, is a fictional creation, many of her cast of supporting characters, from Mary, Queen of Scots on down, are based on historical figures.  Breathtakingly thrilling and meticulously researched, the Lymond Chronicles follow the adventures of the irresistible and indefatigable Francis Crawford, a 16th-century Scottish nobleman. Although her hero travels across Renaissance Europe, from England to Russia, he always returns to Scotland, where Mary, Queen of Scots is still a vulnerable child. With the Lymond Chronicles, Dunnett explains, she \"wished to explore, within several books, the nature and experiences of a classical hero: a gifted leader whose star-crossed career, disturbing, hilarious, dangerous, I could follow in finest detail for ten years. And I wished to set him in the age of the Renaissance.\" The rest, as they say, is history. <h3>Library Journal</h3>Published in 1966, 1961, 1969, and 1964, respectively, these four volumes are the first in Dunnett's popular \"Lymond Chronicles,\" which follows the various adventures of Scottish nobleman Francis Crawford both at home and abroad. Dunnett has been dubbed the world's greatest living historical writer, and her books are an addiction. Librarians should note that the author is a past board member of the National Library of Scotland.",

    "synopsis": "Christine Snow, a successful Chicago therapist, sets out to find her vanished lover, the sultry and elusive travel photographer Taylor Hayes. Forging a trail that leads into the heart of Morocco, Seven Moves tracks Christine's gradual recognition that no one can ever really know another's soul. Bearing Anshaw's trademark style -funny, hip, and laser-sharp -this is \"a tightly told tale that resists the bookmark as well as any thriller\" (Chicago Sun-Times). A Reader's Guide is now available.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>The gift for narrative and character development that Anshaw revealed in her first novel, Aquamarine, are brought to generous fulfillment in this beautifully nuanced novel that traces a woman's troubled search for identity. When lesbian Chicago psychologist Chris Snow realizes that her lover, Taylor Heyes, has left her, it is not only her emotional equilibrium that is threatened. As she eventually discovers, charismatic photographer Taylor had many secrets and a dark side of which others, but not Chris, were aware. Chris fears that since she failed to understand the crucial relationship of her life, perhaps her work as a therapist also has no validity. Anshaw's account of Chris's confusion and grief and her shaky journey to self-understanding is completely absorbing. A fascinating clue to Chris's vulnerability and lack of self-esteem is revealed in flashbacks to her youth, when she was sidekick and accomplice to her father, a charming con man and card-sharp. Other characters are drawn with panache, including the elusive Taylor, the couple's various lesbian friends, Chris's Hispanic clients and her straight partner, even a chronically insecure dog. Anshaw's prose is supple and vigorous, providing quirky and surprising insights and witty dialogue. She surveys the terrain of female sexuality with frankness and compassion. While this novel will surely appeal to a lesbian audience, its truths about human nature should appeal to all thoughtful readers. (Oct.)",

    "synopsis": "<P>Adams is back with the amazing, unprecedented, logic-defying fifth novel in the Hitchhiker trilogy. Random, the daughter of Arthur Dent, has grown up on a remote world at the edge of the universe. Now she sets out on a transgalactic quest to find the planet of her ancestors. Unabridged. 5 CDs.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>Ford Prefect, of the planet Betelgeuse, and Earthman Arthur Dent began their whimsical odyssey in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. In Adams' latest book, Ford relies on serendipity and his own quick wits to protect a powerful new edition of the Hitchhiker's Guide from the loathsome, sluglike Vogons. Ford's pal, Arthur, misses his planet and his old flame, Tricia McMillan. The rootless traveler from Earth finds his metier, however, on Lamuella, a world whose people subsist on Perfectly Normal Beast. Adams sets a rapid pace that becomes even more hectic when Arthur is unexpectedly joined by Tricia; her peevish teenage daughter; Ford Prefect; and the travel guide to the stars. The book once looked like a hand-held computer; now it takes the shape of a mechanical talking bird. Using new techniques, this floating device can whisk users through space and time. Thus the scene shifts back to Earth, where the past, present and future braid together. Adams may depend too much on the cliffhanger form. But his ingenious wit still captivates, and his characters frolic through the galaxy with infectious joy. (Oct.)",

    "synopsis": "<em>ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY</em> contains far more than just the funniest collection of autobiographical essays - it quite well registers as a manifesto about language itself. Wherever there's a straight line, you can be sure that Sedaris lurks beneath the text, making it jagged with laughter; and just where the fault lines fall, he sits mischievously perched at the epicenter of it all.<br>\n<br>\n \nNo medium available to mankind is spared his cultural vision; no family member (even the dynasties of family pets) is forgotten in these pages of sardonic memories of Sedaris's numerous incarnations in North Carolina, Chicago, New York, and France.\nOne essay, punctuated by a conspicuous absence of s's and plurals, introduces the lisping young fifth-grader David \"Thedarith,\" who arms himself with a thesaurus, learns every nonsibilant word in the lexicon, eludes his wily speech therapy teacher, and amazes his countrified North Carolina teachers with his out-of-nowhere and man-size vocabulary.\nBy an ironic twist of fate, readers find present-day Sedaris in France, where only now, after all these years, he must cling safely to just plural nouns so as to avoid assigning the wrong genders to French objects. (Never mind that ordering items from the grocer becomes rather expensive.) Even the strictest of grammarians won't be able to look at the parts of speech in the same way after exposing themselves to the linguistic phenomena of Sedarisian humor. Just why is a sandwich masculine, and yet, say, a belt is feminine in the French language? As he stealthily tries to decode French, like a cross between a housewife and a shrewddetective, he earns the contempt of his sadistic French teacher and soon even resorts to listening to American books on tape for secret relief.\nWhat David Sedaris has to say about language classes, his brother's gangsta-rap slang, typewriters, computers, audiobooks, movies, and even restaurant menus is sure to unleash upon the world a mad rash of pocket-dictionary-toting nouveau grammarians who bow their heads to a new, inverted word order.",

    "synopsis": "A member of the Endless, a family of beings who have existed longer than the gods, Death enjoys manifesting herself in the persona of a young Gothic girl. Along with her siblings, she interacts and influences the lives of humans on a daily basis. In this manga-style adventure, Death's little sisters, Delirium and Despair, have thrown a party at her apartment for hell's escapees. But as the festivities get out of control, it falls on Death's black-clad shoulders to regain order and save the afterlife. Printed in black, white, and gray tones, this trade paperback weaves an eccentric tale of danger, romance, humor, and fun. SUGGESTED FOR MATURE READERS.<h3>Library Journal</h3>In this manga-esque spin-osff of Neil Gaiman's popular series, Thompson presents a retelling of some of the events of the fourth \"Sandman\" volume, Season of Mists, interspersed with new material of her own. Here, the Sandman (a.k.a. Dream) goes to Hell to try to free an old lover, and Lucifer, who has closed Hell and sent away all of the demons and souls, gives Dream the key to Hell. As Dream deals with the various gods and other beings who desire the key, Dream's sister, the popular goth girl Death, throws a party for Hell's inhabitants. Thompson's Death is undeniably cute, and the retelling of the original story in shojo manga (girls' comics) style is compelling, but the comedy at Death's party clashes with the seriousness of Dream's story. This is probably a better introduction to \"Sandman\" for manga fans than vice versa, but those who are already fans of both will be entertained. There's a bit of nudity (actually, Despair is always nude). Recommended for older teens and adults, wherever \"Sandman\" is popular. Copyright 2004 Reed Business Information.",

And when a message from the ancient Druid, Allanon, reaches them, Par is ordered to recover the long-lost Sword of Shinnara, and the glory that once was the Four Lands....<h3>Library Journal</h3>Three hundred years after the death of the druid Allanon, a sinister Federation rules the Four Lands. Dark creatures stalk a countryside now bereft of magic--except for the \"wishsong'' magic of young Par Ohmsford, the final hope of a troubled world. Brooks (\"The Magic Kingdom of Landover\" series) revisits the world of his earlier Shannara trilogy for a rewakening of the continual struggle between good and evil. Engaging characters and a solid grasp of the art of storytelling enliven this traditional epic fantasy. Recommended. Previewed in Prepub Alert, LJ 11/1/89.",

A reader&#8217;s guide is available for this Starscape edition<b>&#8212;</b>perfect for readers ten and up<b>&#8212;</b>of the beloved science fiction classic by best-selling author Orson Scott Card.<h3>Norah Piehl - Children's Literature</h3>This twenty-five-year-old science fiction classic has been repackaged for younger readers. Unlike many hard-core science fiction titles, this book is particularly appropriate for a younger audience, for its protagonist, Ender Wiggin, is just six years old at the novel's beginning and still a pre-teen at its end. Ender's parents have received a special dispensation to have a third child in spite of strict population control laws. His brilliant older siblings, Peter and Valentine, have each showed great promise, but each falls just short of having \"the right stuff.\" The International Fleet (I.F.) believes that Ender may be the commander they need to lead great armies against invasion by alien \"buggers.\" When Ender does exhibit the desired combination of compassion and cruelty, the I.F. takes him to the distant Battle School, where brilliant children are trained in military strategy and tactics. The centerpiece of their education is a simulated battle game at which Ender quickly excels, eventually becoming the youngest commander in history. Life at Battle School, especially these battle games, is richly described. Ender is portrayed as just a pawn in the larger game being played by the I.F., and readers will alternately sympathize with his exploitation and cheer when he is able to make friends in spite of the tremendous forces working to isolate and dehumanize him. The political and philosophical material at the novel's end may get too heavy for some readers, but for the most part, this novel will deservedly reach a new generation through this new edition.",

    "synopsis": "Rebecca Bloomwood just hit rock bottom. But she's never looked better....\nBecky Bloomwood has a fabulous flat in London's trendiest neighborhood, a troupe of glamorous socialite friends, and a closet brimming with the season's must-haves. The only trouble is that she can't actually afford it—not any of it.\nHer job writing at Successful Savings not only bores her to tears, it doesn't pay much at all. And lately Becky's been chased by dismal letters from Visa and the Endwich Bank—letters with large red sums she can't bear to read—and they're getting ever harder to ignore.\nShe tries cutting back; she even tries making more money. But none of her efforts succeeds. Becky's only consolation is to buy herself something ... just a little something....\nFinally a story arises that Becky actually cares about, and her front-page article catalyzes a chain of events that will transform her life—and the lives of those around her—forever.\nSophie Kinsella has brilliantly tapped into our collective consumer conscience to deliver a novel of our times—and a heroine who grows stronger every time she weakens. Becky Bloomwood's hilarious schemes to pay back her debts are as endearing as they are desperate. Her \"confessions\" are the perfect pick-me-up when life is hanging in the (bank) balance.",

Decir que la novela heroica, espléndida, elocuente, desinhibida, ha retornado de pronto en una época de un antirromanticismo casi patológico, sería inadecuado. Para quienes vivimos en esa extraña época, el retorno -y el alivio que nos trae- es sin duda lo más importante. Pero para la historia misma de la novela -una historia que se remonta a la Odisea y a antes de la Odisea- no es un retorno, sino un paso adelante o una revolución: la conquista de un territorio nuevo.",

    "synopsis": "<P> <I>Catch-22</I> is like no other novel we have ever read. It has its own style, its own rationale, its own extraordinary character. It moves back and forth from hilarity to horror. It is outrageously funny and strangely affecting. It is totally original. <P> It is set in the closing months of World War II, in an American bomber squadron on a small island off Italy. Its hero is a bombardier named Yossarian, who is frantic and furious because thousands of people he hasn't even met keep trying to kill him. (He has decided to live forever even if he has to die in the attempt.) <P> His problem is Colonel Cathcart, who keeps raising the number of missions the men have to fly. <P> The others range from Lieutenant Milo Minderbinder, a dedicated entrepreneur (he bombs his own airfield when the Germans make him a reasonable offer: cost plus 6%), to the dead man in Yossarian's tent; from Major Major Major, whose tragedy is that he resembles Henry Fonda, to Nately's whore's kid sister; from Lieutenant Scheisskopf (he loves a parade) to Major -- de Coverley, whose face is so forbidding no one has ever dared ask him his first name; from Clevinger, who is lost in the clouds, to the soldier in white, who lies encased in bandages from head to toe and may not even be there at all; from Dori Duz, who does, to the wounded gunner Snowden, who lies dying in the tail of Yossarian's plane and at last reveals his terrifying secret. <P> <I>Catch-22</I> is a microcosm of the twentieth-century world as it might look to someone dangerously sane. It is a novel that lives and moves and grows with astonishing power and vitality. It is, we believe, one of the strongest creations of the mid-century.<h3>The Nation - Nelson Algren</h3>Below its hilarity, so wild that it hurts, <i>Catch-22</i> is the strongest repudiation of our civilization, in fiction, to come out of World War II.... To compare <i>Catch-22</i> favorably with <i>The Good Soldier Schweik</i> would be an injustice, because this novel is not merely the best American novel to come out of World War II; it is the best American novel that has come out of anywhere in years.",

    "synopsis": "In the silent pre-dawn city hours -- alone with his thoughts about Rina Lazarus, the woman he loves, three thousand miles away in New York -- LAPD detective Peter Decker finds a small child, abandoned and covered in blood that is not hers. It is a sobering discovery, and a perplexing one, for nobody in the development where she was found steps forward to claim the little girl. Obsessed more deeply by this case than he imagined possible, Decker is determined to follow the scant clues to an answer. But his trail is leading him to a killing ground where four bodies lie still and lifeless. And by the time Rina returns, Peter Decker is already held fast in a sticky mass of hatred, passion, and murder -- in a world where intense sweetness is accompanied by a deadly sting.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>On a summer night in a housing development near Los Angeles, police sergeant Peter Decker finds a winsome two-year-old girl playing on a swing set--and wearing blood-soaked pajamas. Unclaimed, ``Sally'' is placed in a foster home while Decker and partner Marge Dunn try to learn her identity. Bee stings on her arms lead them days later to the scene of a bloody multiple murder at a honey farm. While piecing together a bizarre puzzle of betrayal and revenge which includes adultery, infertility and land development plans, Peter is also investigating rape and assault charges brought against an old army buddy from Vietnam. The pressures of the murder case and doubts about his friend's innocence compound Peter's anxiety as he waits for young Orthodox Jewish widow Rina Lazarus to decide if she will marry him--an older man who's only recently embraced his Jewish heritage. Kellerman weaves these threads into a believable, intricate mystery in which series hero Decker is revealed as even more complex, interesting and sympathetic than in earlier appearances ( Sacred and Profane ).

    "synopsis": "At a party in Manhattan, Maggie Holloway -- one of the fashion world's most successful photographers -- is thrilled to be reunited with her beloved stepmother. A widow now, Nuala Moore is equally delighted to see her long-lost stepdaughter, and invites Maggie to spend a few weeks at her home in Newport, Rhode Island.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>Pretty photographer Maggie Holloway begins Clark's latest (after Silent Night) lying in a coffin buried in a grave, pulling desperately at a string that leads to a bell with no clapper. How she got there is the essence of a convoluted tale of a ritzy Newport, R.I., retirement home whose well-heeled residents seem to die with alarming frequency, leading to high-profit turnover of their apartments there. Latest to shed her mortal coil was Maggie's much-loved stepmother, a fact that led intrepid Maggie to take an unwise amount of interest in the deaths-and also to question why several of the graves seemed to have little funerary bells on them. As usual with Clark, there is a stalwart admirer whose love does not immediately speak its name, and a surfeit of suspicious characters, including a scholarly funeral nut, a shady investment broker, a venal lawyer, a drunken, inept doctor and a nosy nurse. There's some fun in the sprightly Newport oldsters, and the many scenes and characters are shifted around smoothly and with a practiced hand. The bells gimmick seems no more than that, however, and the book is light on thrills-though there's nothing to put off Clark's myriad fans.

    "synopsis": "A first novel of startling scope and ambition, <b>Prague</b> depicts an intentionally lost Lost Generation as it follows five American expats who come to Budapest in the early 1990s to seek their fortune financial, romantic, and spiritual in an exotic city newly opened to the West.<h3>Book Magazine</h3>Prague is one of the best first novels I've read in several years. It is also one of the most challenging, for Arthur Phillips reworks the nineteenth-century international novel, the setting-saturated, character-centered, slow-moving form practiced by Henry James. Readers used to the action-oriented plots that drive much of the contemporary fiction about Americans abroad will need to adjust to the more complex and more subtle intertwining of stories that Phillips presents. Like the old and beautiful city for which the novel is named, Prague requires and rewards leisurely exploration. <BR> <BR> Prague opens in Budapest in May 1990. Five North Americans in their mid- to late twenties sit in a cafe and play Sincerity, a game in which each participant makes five statements others have to judge as true or false. What the characters state about themselves and how they respond to their friends set up an immediately interesting dynamic that Phillips complicates and then extends by bringing other people into the initial group. \"Somehow this one game of Sincerity becomes the distilled recollection of a much longer series of events,\" Phillips writes. \"It persistently rises to the surface of your memory&#151;that afternoon when you fell in love with a person or a place or a mood, when you savored the power of fooling everyone, when you discovered some great truth about the world.\" <BR> <BR> Charles Gabor, master of Sincerity and insincerity, is a Hungarian-American venture capitalist bottom-feeding in the newly open economy. Mark Payton, who recently earned a doctorate in cultural studies, is passionately committed to his scholarly analysis of nostalgia in different cultures. Emily Oliver, alow-level employee at the American Embassy, says she's incapable of lying. Scott Price, a California health faddist teaching English, is a master of irony. His younger brother John, a recent arrival who becomes a columnist for the English-language newspaper, is Phillips' focal character, a person who oscillates between sincerity and insincerity. <BR> <BR> In this novel about the search for authenticity, all five of the main characters have secret desires that move them and the book forward. Charles plots the takeover of a small Hungarian publisher for himself, not for his firm. Mark pursues other men. The wholesome Nebraska-bred Emily has a lesbian liaison. And always-flippant Scott turns out to be seriously engaged with a Hungarian woman. <BR> <BR> John Price is more complicated. Although he moons over Emily, he has sex with several other women, including his brother's girlfriend. John follows Mark's lead in studying old Budapest, yet helps Charles plot against the hoary publisher who symbolizes the city's history. Toward the end, the business takeover provides some conventional suspense; but the characters' changing responses to one another and to a closely observed setting are the author's primary interests and, in turn, become the reader's. <BR> <BR> Phillips has said he suffers from \"hyperglycemic nostalgia,\" and Prague longs for the \"seriousness\"&#151;a key word in the book&#151;of nineteenth-century fiction. Phillips narrates the story omnisciently and persistently, usually choosing indirect discourse over dialogue. The effect is authorial high seriousness, but with a touch of haughty superiority. The characters don't seem to satisfy their creator, not even the \"authentic\" Hungarians, not the aged publisher Imre Horvath, not the elderly jazz pianist Nadja. Their history as victims of both Nazis and communists gives them an initial appeal that Phillips diminishes as they become self-promoting windbags, perhaps to impress the outsiders. <BR> <BR> If Budapest can't measure up to Prague (a place the characters never go), and if Phillips' characters can't measure up to his ideal of authentic living, I can say&#151;as a part-time resident of a Balkan country&#151;that Phillips gets just right the eccentricities of an expatriate community. Living at the edge of familiar European culture makes his characters intensely conscious of themselves and their friends. Most enjoy being \"exotic\" without doing anything to earn that label. English teacher Scott knows no Hungarian and takes pleasure from living outside of language. Several characters suffer from the dread \"Visiting Family Syndrome\" that takes them away from their friends. Those in the country for six months resent recent arrivals, and anyone with an apartment mocks tourists. In one of the novel's great comic moments, Charles, Mark and John give a student travel writer a mass of specious information about \"authentic\" Budapest destinations. <BR> <BR> Phillips also finds inventive ways of presenting Hungarian history that contrasts with the shallow pasts of his North American characters. The 200-year-old publishing firm, which did business with a succession of governments, represents Hungarian political life. Buildings that the characters live in or move among still have bullet marks from the 1956 \"revolution,\" and the old pianist Nadja tells stories of Hungarians who were frequently forced into exile. Phillips' characters keep saying Budapest is no Prague, but Phillips makes the city as fascinating to readers as Prague is to his characters. <BR> <BR> At 380 densely printed pages, Prague is unusually long for a first novel by an unknown writer. To do full justice to its numerous characters, it needed to be longer yet. The Americans compare themselves to the Lost Generation of Americans in Paris in the '20s, but Phillips is too serious a writer to engage in this kind of shortcut, group characterization. <BR> <BR> Although Phillips knows&#151;as a resident alien, as a novelist&#151;that authenticity is earned, he or his editor didn't allow Prague the space to fully become what it initially promised to be. But Phillips promises to be a strong new American voice, and Prague is the largest-minded first novel since Mark Z. Danielewski's audacious House of Leaves in 2000.<BR>",

    "synopsis": "Hilarious, sexy, and deeply tender, <b>Kissing in Manhattan</b> was one of the most celebrated debuts in recent years. Acclaimed author David Schickler’s collection of linked stories follows a troupe of love-hungry urbanites through a charmed metropolis and into the Preemption--a mythic Manhattan apartment building. The Preemption sets the stage for a romantic fantasy as exuberant, dark, and dazzling as the city it occupies. Behind closed doors, the paths of an improbable cast of tenants--a seductive perfume heiress; a crabby, misunderstood actor; a preternaturally sharp-sighted priest--tangle and cross, while a perilous love triangle builds around three characters: \nJames Branch, a shy young accountant with an unusual love for the Preemption’s antique elevator, and a strange destiny...\nPatrick Rigg, a Wall Street lothario who soothes his pain by seducing beautiful women, carrying a gun, and attending the nightly sermons of a foreboding priest...\nRally McWilliams, a fetching, hopeful young writer who roams the city at night, searching for the soulmate she believes in but can’t find...\nCharged with joy and a deadly sense of humor, <b>Kissing in Manhattan</b> is a daring new writer’s vision of a world where men and women, good and evil, love and sex, meet, battle, and embrace on every street corner.",

    "synopsis": "<P>After her marriage to Damien ended in disaster, Londoner Josie Flynn &#151; thirtysomething and single again &#151; is flying across the ocean to her American cousin's \"big mistake\" wedding. In her present \"love stinks\" frame of mind, the last person she expects to be seated next to on the flight is someone like Matt Jarvis. A recently divorced rock journalist, Matt is sensitive, good-looking, and remarkably attentive &#151; and before their plane touches down, Josie's smitten. So how can she hope to convince her cousin to cut and run when Josie is all ready to leap into love again &#151; with a stranger, no less, who might be just another Mr. Totally Wrong in Mr. Seductively Right's clothing?<P>The point is rendered moot, of course, once they deplane and she and Matt go their separate ways. After all, Josie's got prenuptial confabs to worry about and that dreaded lilac chiffon bridesmaid's dress to wear. But Dante himself couldn't have dreamed up the hell <i>this</i> wedding is proving to be &#151; and when her dream hunk reappears and throws himself into the mix, Josie finds herself wondering how she &#151; or any unattached modern woman, in fact &#151; can hope to survive the new romantic rules of the twenty-first century.<P>Already a bestseller in the U.K., Carole Matthews's <i>For Better, for Worse</i> is a deliriously droll, dead-on tale of marriage, sex, monogamy, and modern love.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>Josephine Josie Flynn is a latter-day Bridget Jones, but without the cuteness, the sardonic humor or the wry introspection that made Ms. Jones so lovable (and her story so profitable). In this novel by bestselling English author Matthews, Josie is newly single and en route from London to her American cousin's wedding in New York, when she meets Matt Jarvis, an aspiring rock journalist who captures her attention and asks for a date as soon as their plane touches down. When they just miss each other at the appointed restaurant, madness ensues as Josie's ex-husband decides to jet to the wedding to win her back, and Matt becomes entangled with a publicist for a regrettable boy band, which covers the Beatles but doesn't even know who they were. There are moments of comedy and others of introspection in Matthews's book about the single life and how singletons strive to overcome their lot (often, it seems, by attending weddings, even ones to which they haven't been invited). Despite some humorous inventions (such as the Conversation Termination Sequence, an escape hatch from endless phone calls with her bodily functions$obsessed mother) and melancholy revelations ( somehow she was going to have to let the barriers down again, otherwise no one would ever get inside her protective shell to find the real Josie hiding there ), Matthews mostly fails to mine a deeper meaning from the characters and situations she creates as she entertains her readers with serendipitous trysts and near-misses. Still, Josie, unlike Bridget, never carps about her weight, and for that women readers can be thankful. (May) Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information.",

Mark Dooher, Head Of A High-powered San Francisco Law Firm, Pushing 50 And Tired Of His Alcoholic Wife, Is Smitten With Beautiful Law Student Christina Carrera. He Begins A Subtle Campaign To Woo Her, Revealing Himself To Readers (the Little Compliments, The Kindnesses) As Manipulative, But Believably So.

With Dooher's Best Friend, Wes Farrell, Leading The Defense (with Christina As Second Chair), The Cold-blooded Attorney Takes On The Police, The Court And Various Hostile Witnesses. What Raises The Dramamarred Only By A Perfunctory Endingto An Unusually Sophisticated Level Is Not Just The Crackling Legal Action But Also Infusions Of The Melting-pot Tensions Of San Francisco, Old-fashioned Church Politics (including A Priest Suffering A Nervous Breakdown After A Murderer's Confession) And Strong Secondary Characters (a Feisty Rape Counselor, A Canny Archbishop, A Smart And Ambitious Vietnamese Detective).

But there is no welcome for the prodigal daughter at the lavish Louisiana estate.Her stepcousin, Seth, once her only comfort, is icy, dangerously attractive &#8212; and engaged. Her formidable stepgrandfather collapses with a heart attack at the sight of her, gasping her dead mother&#8217;s name&#58; &#8220;Selena!&#8221;The bayou echoes with memories of her mother&#8217;s mysterious death. Suicide by drowning, they said. But Olivia&#8217;s terrifying nightmares suggest another story. She is determined to learn the truth, and to face a newly ignited passion for Seth, who is too close for comfort, despite his vows. When a new danger threatens her and her daughter, Olivia must find the courage to confront her old demons ... and uncover a shocking secret buried in the long-forgotten past....<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>The fainthearted should be warned: Robards (The Midnight Hour) has crafted a mossy modern gothic drenched in gore. In northern Louisiana, little girls die at the hands of a twisted villain, and the author's detached style makes the killings' gruesomeness especially hard to take. The psychotic murderer has kidnapped four girls over the course of a decade, and he's ready to strike again. Will the next victim be eight-year-old Sara, weight-conscious daughter of broke, divorced Olivia Morrison? Or will it be eight-year-old Chloe, glamorous offspring of single dad Seth Archer, Olivia's stepcousin? Livvy and Seth remain blissfully ignorant of lurking danger, consumed with the welter of contradictory emotions kicked up by the ongoing drama in their family. Raised by her stepfamily, the wealthy Archer clan, Livvy left La Angelle Plantation nine years ago to become the teen bride of a no-good cowboy. She has just returned to the Louisiana estate, humbled by her greatly reduced circumstances and with daughter Sara in tow. Though she is welcomed back, Livvy is haunted by shadowy, frightening nightmares and the mystery surrounding her mother's death almost 20 years ago. Robards conveys the dusty heat of the Louisiana summer, and has an ear for the nuances of dialogue. But the cast of characters is so big, and the dramatics so unrelenting, that readers never have a chance to fully absorb the dynamics of the clan, and the serial killings remain an unintegrated subplot till the very end. When the bogeyman makes a move close to home, and Livvy and Seth get romantically involved, the murder mystery and the love story finally, satisfyingly, converge. (Feb.)

    "synopsis": "as A New Age Dawns In England's Twelfth Century, The Building Of A Mighty Gothic Cathedral Sets The Stage For A Story Of Intrigue And Power, Revenge And Betrayal.<h3>publishers Weekly</h3>with This Book, Follett Risks All And Comes Out A Clear Winner, Escaping The Narrow Genre Of Suspense Thrillers To Take Credit For A Historical Novel Of Gripping Readability, Authentic Atmosphere And Detail And Memorable Characterization. Set In 12th-century England, The Narrative Concerns The Building Of A Cathedral In The Fictional Town Of Kingsbridge. The Ambitions Of Three Men Merge, Conflict And Collide Through Four Decades During Which Social And Political Upheaval And The Internal Politics Of The Church Affect The Progress Of The Cathedral And The Fortunes Of The Protagonists. The Insightful Portrayals Of An Idealistic Master Builder, A Pious, Dogmatic But Compassionate Prior And An Unscrupulous, Ruthless Bishop Are Balanced By Those Of A Trio Of Independent, Resourceful Women (one Of Them Quite Loathesome) Who Can Stand On Their Own As Memorable Characters In Any Genre. Beginning With A Mystery That Casts Its Shadow On Ensuing Events, The Narrative Is A Seesaw Of Tension In Which Circumstances Change With Shocking But True-to-life Unpredictability. Follett's Impeccable Pacing Builds Suspense In A Balanced Narrative That Offers Action, Intrigue, Violence And Passion As Well As The Step-by-step Description Of An Edifice Rising In Slow Stages, Its Progress Tied To The Vicissitudes Of Fortune And The Permutations Of Evolving Architectural Style. Follett's Depiction Of The Precarious Balance Of Power Between Monarchy And Religion In The Middle Ages, And Of The Effects Of Social Upheavals And The Forces Of Nature (storms, Famines) On Political Events; His Ability To Convey The Fine Points Of Architecture So That The Cathedral Becomes Clearly Visualized In The Reader's Mind; And Above All, His Portrayals Of The Enduring Human Emotions Of Ambition, Greed, Bravery, Dedication, Revenge And Love, Result In A Highly Engrossing Narrative. Manipulating A Complex Plot In Which The Characters Interact Against A Broad Canvas Of Medieval Life, Follett Has Written A Novel That Entertains, Instructs And Satisfies On A Grand Scale.",

    "synopsis": "<P><center><i>Man, was a a distant shore, and the men spread upon it in wave... Each wave different, and each wave stronger. </i></center><P><b><center>The Martian Chronicles</center></b><P>Ray Bradbury is a storyteller without peer, a poet of the possible, and, indisputably, one of America's most beloved authors. In a much celebrated literary career that has spanned six decades, he has produced an astonishing body of work&#58; unforgettable novels, including <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> and <i>Something Wicked This Way Comes;</i> essays, theatrical works, screenplays and teleplays; <i>The Illustrated Mein, Dandelion Wine, The October Country,</i> and numerous other superb short story collections. But of all the dazzling stars in the vast Bradbury universe, none shines more luminous than these masterful chronicles of Earth's settlement of the fourth world from the sun. <P>Bradbury's Mars is a place of hope, dreams and metaphor-of crystal pillars and fossil seas-where a fine dust settles on the great, empty cities of a silently destroyed civilization. It is here the invaders have come to despoil and commercialize, to grow and to learn -first a trickle, then a torrent, rushing from a world with no future toward a promise of tomorrow. The Earthman conquers Mars ... and then is conquered <i>by</i> it, lulled by dangerous lies of comfort and familiarity, and enchanted by the lingering glamour of an ancient, mysterious native race. <P>Ray Bradbury's <i>The Martian Chronicles</i> is a classic work of twentieth-century literature whose extraordinary power and imagination remain undimmed by time's passage. In connected, chronological stories, a true grandmaster once again enthralls, delights and challenges us with his vision and his heart-starkly and stunningly exposing in brilliant spacelight our strength, our weakness, our folly, and our poignant humanity on a strange and breathtaking world where humanity does not belong.<h3>Gale Research</h3>Russell Kirk feels that the greatest strength of <I>The Martian Chronicles </I>is its ability to make us look closely at ourselves. In <I>Enemies of the Permanent Things: Observations of Abnormality in Literature and Politics, </I> Kirk states: \"What gives [<I>The Martian Chronicles</I>] their cunning is ... their portrayal of human nature, in all its baseness and all its promise, against an exquisite stageset. We are shown normality, the permanent things in human nature, by the light of another world; and what we forget about ourselves in the ordinariness of our routine of existence suddenly bursts upon us as a fresh revelation.... Bradbury's stories are not an escape from reality; they are windows looking upon enduring reality.\"",

Not Only Did He Bring Christianity To Ireland, He Instilled A Sense Of Literacy And Learning That Would Create The Conditions That Allowed Ireland To Become &quot;the Isle Of Saints And Scholars&quot; &#151; And Thus Preserve Western Culture While Europe Was Being Overrun By Barbarians. in This Entertaining And Compelling Narrative, Thomas Cahill Tells The Story Of How Europe Evolved From The Classical Age Of Rome To The Medieval Era. Without Ireland, The Transition Could Not Have Taken Place. Not Only Did Irish Monks And Scribes Maintain The Very Record Of Western Civilization &#151; Copying Manuscripts Of Greek And Latin Writers, Both Pagan And Christian, While Libraries And Learning On The Continent Were Forever Lost &#151; They Brought Their Uniquely Irish World-view To The Task. as Cahill Delightfully Illustrates, So Much Of The Liveliness We Associate With Medieval Culture Has Its Roots In Ireland. When The Seeds Of Culture Were Replanted On The European Continent, It Was From Ireland That They Were Germinated.in The Tradition Of Barbara Tuchman's <b>a Distant Mirror</b>, <b>how The Irish Saved Civilization</b> Reconstructs An Era That Few Know About But Which Is Central To Understanding Our Past And Our Cultural Heritage. But It Conveys Its Knowledge With A Winking Wit That Aptly Captures The Sensibility Of The Unsung Irish Who Relaunched Civilization. <h3>boston Globe</h3> cahill's Lively Prose Breathes Life Into A 1,600 Year-old History.",

    "synopsis": "The widely acclaimed queen of true crime and author of 15 <I>New York Times</I> bestsellers turns her sharp eye to the high-profile case of Anne Marie Fahey, the beautiful secretary of the governor of Delaware, who was brutally murdered by Thomas Capano, a charismatic, politically connected lawyer 17 years her senior -- who was once her trusted confidant and lover. Uncover the real truth behind the headlines with <I>And Never Let Her Go: Thomas Capano: The Deadly Seducer,</I> and find out what drove a narcissistic killer to the high extremes of degradation, cruelty, and violence.With penetrating insight and access to all the principal players -- the investigators and the prosecutors, as well as the multivolume court transcripts -- Ann Rule traces the lives of both Fahey and Capano, uncovering long-buried demons. Rule tracks the investigation from Fahey's disappearance to Capano's last days in court. Capano testified against his defense attorney's protests and blamed the murder on his mistress Debby MacIntryre. To no avail, however: He was found guilty and sentenced to death by lethal injection.Riveting and chilling, <I>And Never Let Her Go</I> probes the depths of an unfathomable tragedy and presents an unsettling close-up of the confident face of evil. <P>  <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> Most people like to think they recognize evil when they see it. But as this gripping story of a 1996 Delaware murder makes clear, most people are wrong. Much more than the profile of a handsome, insidious killer and the young woman he murdered, true-crime veteran Rule's latest is also the story of three close-knit families and how 30-year-old Anne Marie Fahey's death strengthened or destroyed them. When Fahey, the scheduling secretary for Governor Thomas Carper, was reported missing, her relationship with the older, married Capano was known only to a tiny handful of close friends. A prominent lawyer from a powerful local family, Capano had served as a political adviser to local and state officials. But he also had less savory attributes, many revealed during the investigation into Fahey's disappearance and his subsequent murder trial. Fahey was the only woman Capano murdered, but she certainly wasn't his only victim. Both the Faheys and Debby McIntyre, Capano's mistress of 18 years, trusted Rule enough to share details of their lives. Rule (Bitter Harvest, etc.) doesn't betray that trust, nor does she shortchange the Capano family. All those involved emerge as real people whose lives are circumscribed by experience. When Capano's brothers turned state's evidence, revealing their parts in helping dispose of Fahey's body, Capano accused McIntyre of the murder. His ruthlessness, the constancy of the Fahey family and the Capanos' loyalty to Tom (who's now on Delaware's death row) become, in Rule's capable hands, the raw material for a modern-day tragedy.

    "synopsis": "<P>Sheriff Spencer Arrowood keeps the peace in his small Tennessee town most of the time. Every once in a while, though, something goes wrong.<P>When 1960s folksinger Peggy Muryan moves to town seeking solitude and a career comeback, and she receives a postcard with a threatening message, her idyll is shattered. Then a local girl who looks like Peggy vanishes without a trace.<P>Although she was once famous, Peggy has no fondness for the old times. Those days are best left forgotten for Spencer Arrowood, too. But sometimes the past can't rest, and those who try to forget it are doomed to relive it....<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>McCrumb surpasses lauded earlier novels, including 1988 Edgar winner Bimbos of the Death Sun , with this inventive mystery. Sheriff Spencer Arrowood remembers Peggy Muryan, a newcomer to Hamelin, Tenn., as a moderately popular folksinger of the 1960s. Hoping to compose fresh songs in the quiet town, Peggy instead attracts messages from a secret killer. Arrowood and Deputy Joe LeDonne answer her call for help and the latter, a Vietnam veteran, recognizes descriptions of the war's horrors in the threats. Peggy's dog is killed, and later a girl with a strong resemblance to her, but it's a long, suspenseful struggle for the sheriff and his right-hand man to learn the terrible, astonishing facts in the case. A superior mystery, the book is also a masterful drama of lives shaped by traumatic events, as McCrumb bares the psyches of her characters. Mystery Book Club selection. (Apr.)",

    "synopsis": "America's favorite Southern-fried, stand-up comedian and star of the WB's hit show, <I>Blue Collar TV</I>, Jeff Foxworthy brings his humor to the page in this riotous laugh-out-loud book. In <I>No Shirt. No Shoes . . . No Problem!</I>, Foxworthy exposes the hilarity of growing up, love, sex, crazy families, roommates, friendship, mooning, having a crush on your cousin, and the real stories behind many of his favorite Redneck jokes.</P> <P>And let's not forget the Bonus section: The Redneck Aptitude Test.</P> <P>Being a Redneck has nothing to do with where you live. It's a state of mind, \"a glorious absence of sophistication.\" Some of us live there, and some of us simply go on an extended vacation. So pull up a lawn chair, grab some ribs off the barbecue, and stay a while.</P> <P>You're in for a helluva good time.</P> <P>Jeff Foxworthy is one of the most respected and successful comedians in the country. He is the largest selling comedy-recording artist in history, a multiple Grammy Award-nominee and best selling author of 11 books. Widely known for his redneck jokes, his act goes well beyond that to explore the humor in everyday family interactions and human nature, a style that has been compared to Mark Twain's. Currently he is starring in and executive producing the television series he created for the WB network, \"Blue Collar TV.\" Foxworthy also has his own radio show \"The Foxworthy Countdown,\" which is syndicated in more than 220 markets. He is a regular on \"The Late Show with David Letterman\" and has an HBO special and two Showtime specials to his credit.</P> <P>This Georgia native remains true to his southern roots and resides with his wife and two daughters in Atlanta. <h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3> The star of his eponymous television show has hit it big with recordings and paperbacks (You Might Be a Redneck If, not reviewed, etc.) and now presents more of what was once called rube comedy.<P>He plows the same field thoroughly worked by his fellow Atlantan, the late Lewis Grizzard, and a sort of yokel dybbuk appears to be at work as Foxworthy recounts yarns of his wayward blue-collar, redneck boyhood. Projectile vomiting seems to have been the most debonair of activities, and we are presented with enough instruction in the finer points of mooning to threaten the firmest of civilizations. What passes for Foxworthy's life story, thus far, involves fishing with granddaddy, life with oft-married mamma (a.k.a. Carole), encouragement of his sporting life by oft- married daddy (a.k.a. Big Jim), courtship rituals of Dixie denizens, and the manly art of maintaining a singles' apartment. The relationship between hunting and gender isn't scanted&#58; \"All men delight in pursuits that disgust women. Hunting is near the top of the list,\" he says. \"You never see deer heads in beauty parlors.\" To complete the picture, add some talk about a lot of nasty relatives, a little attention to body effluents, and a discussion of the author's vasectomy. (He, like may gents down his way, is much concerned with his \"package\" and, one supposes, may some day have to be persuaded not to show you his operation.) Foxworthy, a slick Southerner who kind of likes his celebrity, provides simple fodder for his fans.<P> The hillbilly hijinks, to be fair, are mildly entertaining, but you might be a redneck if you take this text for anything more than showbiz ephemera.<P>",

That's why Episcopal minister Clare Fergusson is shocked when the July Fourth weekend brings a rash of vicious assaults to the scenic town. Even Clare's good friend, police chief Russ Van Alstyne, is shaken by the brutality of the crimes-especially when it appears that the victims were chosen because they are gay. But when a third assault of an out-of-town developer ends in murder, Clare and Russ wonder if the recent crime wave is connected to the victim's controversial plan to open an upscale spa in Miller's Kill. But not all things in the tiny town are what they seem-and soon, Clare and Russ are left to fight their unspoken attraction to one another even as they uncover a labyrinthine conspiracy that threatens to turn deadly for them both...<P><b>\"[Spencer-Fleming] pulls it off again.\" -Chicago Tribune </b><P><b>\"Spencer-Fleming's second cozy-cum-thriller to feature the Reverend Clare Fergusson...is every bit as riveting as her first...with eloquent exposition and natural dialogue, the precisely constructed plot moves effortlessly to its dramatic conclusion.\" -Publishers Weekly (starred review)</b><h3>The Washington Post</h3>This is the second installment of Spencer-Fleming's series featuring Episcopalian priest Clare Fergusson. She is a quietly gutsy former military chaplain and chopper pilot who, unmarried at 35 and not crazy about it, has an aching crush on the local police chief, Russ Van Alstyne. While committed to his marriage, the chief goes weak-kneed despite himself whenever he is around Fergusson. &mdash; <i>Richard Lipez</i>",

    "synopsis": "<P>With only a yellowing photograph in hand, a young man &#151; also named Jonathan Safran Foer &#151; sets out to find the woman who may or may not have saved his grandfather from the Nazis. Accompanied by an old man haunted by memories of the war; an amorous dog named Sammy Davis, Junior, Junior; and the unforgettable Alex, a young Ukrainian translator who speaks in a sublimely butchered English, Jonathan is led on a quixotic journey over a devastated landscape and into an unexpected past.<P>By turns comic and tragic, but always passionate, wildly inventive, and touched with an indelible humanity, this debut novel is a powerful, deeply felt story of searching&#58; for the past, family, and truth.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>What would it sound like if a foreigner wrote a novel in broken English? Foer answers this question to marvelous effect in his inspired though uneven first novel. Much of the book is narrated by Ukrainian student Alex Perchov, whose hilarious and, in their own way, pitch-perfect malapropisms flourish under the influence of a thesaurus. Alex works for his family's travel agency, which caters to Jews who want to explore their ancestral shtetls. Jonathan Safran Foer, the novel's other hero, is such a Jew an American college student looking for the Ukrainian woman who hid his grandfather from the Nazis. He, Alex, Alex's depressive grandfather and his grandfather's \"seeing-eye bitch\" set out to find the elusive woman. Alex's descriptions of this \"very rigid search\" and his accompanying letters to Jonathan are interspersed with Jonathan's own mythical history of his grandfather's shtetl. Jonathan's great-great-great-great-great-grandmother Brod is the central figure in this history, which focuses mostly on the 18th and 19th centuries. Though there are some moments of demented genius here, on the whole the historical sections are less assured. There's a whiff of kitsch in Foer's jolly cast of pompous rabbis, cuckolded usurers and sharp-tongued widows, and the tone wavers between cozy ethnic humor, heady pontification and sentimental magic-realist whimsy. Nonetheless, Foer deftly handles the intricate story-within-a-story plot, and the layers of suspense build as the shtetl hurtles toward the devastation of the 20th century while Alex and Jonathan and Grandfather close in on the object of their search. An impressive, original debut. (Apr. 16) Forecast: Eagerly awaited since an excerpt was featured in the New Yorker's 2001 \"Debut Fiction\" issue, Everything Is Illuminated comes reasonably close to living up to the hype. Rights have so far been sold in 12 countries, the novel is a selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club and a main selection of Traditions Book Club, and Foer will embark on an author tour expect lively sales.

    "synopsis": "<CENTER>A NEW WORLD ORDER...ON THE BRINK OF DESTRUCTION</CENTER> <P> Peace may finally be at hand in the Middle East -- as Jack Ryan lays the groundwork for a plan that could end centuries of conflict. But ruthless terrorists have a final, desperate card to play; with one terrible act, distrust mounts,forces collide, and the floundering U.S. president seems unable to copewith the crisis. <P> With the world on the verge of nuclear disaster, Ryan must frantically seek a solution -- before the chiefs of state lose control of themselves and the world. <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> Clancy evolves from storyteller to novelist in his latest techno-thriller, as gadgets take second place to politics and personalities. In the late 1990s the world is cautiously emerging from the Cold War; even the Arab-Israeli conflict is being resolved, thanks to the cleverness of Clancy's hero Jack Ryan. But as confrontation yields to cooperation, what becomes of displaced terrorists? Palestinians without a cause and East Germans without a country seek to rekindle U.S.-U.S.S.R. animosity. A small nuclear device is exploded at the Super Bowl; in Berlin American and Russian troops are tricked into firing on each other; residual suspicions carry the action from there. After the solution of the Middle East crisis serves as an exciting preliminary to the main plot, the novel's middle parts seem a recycling of situations and characters from Red October and Cardinal of the Kremlin. But in the last third of the book Clancy integrates story lines, taking readers on a nonstop roller-coaster ride to a nail-biting finish. Fundamentally, Clancy is writing about a vital and elusive quality: grace under pressure. Whether terrorists or statesmen, Clancy's characters face a common challenge--situations that break down pretensions of rank, power and ideology. Their responses, carefully and empathetically constructed, make this book compelling instead of merely ingenious. (Aug.)",

    "synopsis": "A Hollywood Curse?\nFor years Hollywood has buzzed with rumors of a curse on the actors who starred in the '50s classic film <i>Rebel Without a Cause</i>. It started with James Dean crashing his Porsche and continued through Nick Adams' overdose, Sal Mineo's murder, and Natalie Wood's drowning. But what if it wasn't really a curse, and what if Dean didn't die in that fiery crash?\nLos Angeles newspaper columnist Neil Gulliver and his ex-wife Stevie Marriner, the \"sex queen of the soaps,\" are on the job and come up with an interesting hypothesis: James Dean is still alive today—and is looking for revenge!\nHowever, nothing about James Dean is as it seems, not the truth and certainly not the lies. But which is which?",

    "synopsis": "A heartstrong story of family and romance, tribulation and tenacity, set on the High Plains east of Denver.<br>In the small town of Holt, Colorado, a high school teacher is confronted with raising his two boys alone after their mother retreats first to the bedroom, then altogether.<h3>Joshua Klein</h3>Kent Haruf's third novel <i>Plainsong</i>-- already been nominated for the National Book Award--indicates just how much the novel has resonated with readers. Haruf himself must be surprised, but not that surprised: A professor at Southern Illinois University and an honest-to-goodness son of a preacher, Haruf is so adept at capturing the heart of an innocent side of America that it's hard to believe anyone wouldn't be affected by his work. <i>Plainsong</i> is set in Holt, Colorado, a rural community well outside Denver; the setting is timeless, with only the occasional, fleeting reference to VCRs or pop culture indicating that the book takes place closer to \"now\" than \"then.\" Tom Guthrie is a high-school teacher left raising two young sons after his depressed and disappointed wife moves to the city. His children bake cookies, ride horses, and run a paper route, but at the same time they almost consciously seek out a cool, hardened, cowboy sense of maturity. Meanwhile, another teacher helps a pregnant teen disowned by her mother find love and acceptance in two hilariously well-intentioned elderly brothers. The two tentatively take the girl on as a boarder on their cattle farm even though they barely know how to communicate with anyone but each other. These seven characters form the core of <i>Plainsong</i>, which switches vantages from chapter to chapter like a more direct Faulkner, though the prose is no less poetic and evocative. Through this device, Haruf illustrates how relationships are formed and what makes them last, how responsibility and accountability make people good, and how cooperation can make a small town strong in times of conflict. A fast, encouraging, enlightening read, Plainsong is beautiful, real, and wise: a true great American novel.",

    "synopsis": "The hill people and the Mexicans arrived on the same day. It was a Wednesday, early in September 1952. The Cardinals were five games behind the Dodgers with three weeks to go, and the season looked hopeless. The cotton, however, was waist-high to my father, over my head, and he and my grandfather could be heard before supper whispering words that were seldom heard. It could be a &quot;good crop.&quot; Thus begins the new novel from John Grisham, a story inspired by his own childhood in rural Arkansas. The narrator is a farm boy named Luke Chandler, age seven, who lives in the cotton fields with his parents and grandparents in a little house that&#39;s never been painted. The Chandlers farm eighty acres that they rent, not own, and when the cotton is ready they hire a truckload of Mexicans and a family from the Ozarks to help harvest it.<br> <br>For six weeks they pick cotton, battling the heat, the rain, the fatigue, and, sometimes, each other. As the weeks pass Luke sees and hears things no seven-year-old could possibly be prepared for, and finds himself keeping secrets that not only threaten the crop but will change the lives of the Chandlers forever.<i>A Painted House </i>is a moving story of one boy&#39;s journey from innocence to experience.<h3>Entertainment Weekly</h3>He takes command of this literary category just as forcefully as he did legal thrillers with <i>The Firm</i>. Never let it be said this man doesn't know how to spin a good yarn....The kind of book you read slowly because you don't want it to end.",

    "synopsis": "Music industry legend Bob Thiele will never forget the first time he heard a demo tape from a group of unknowns from New Mexico billed as Buddy Holly and the Crickets. \"I was never as confident in my life anything would be a hit record as I was about 'That'll Be the Day',\" remembers the record executive and producer who also worked with Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Jackie Wilson, Henry Mancini, and a constellation of other greats on some of their most memorable recordings. But Thiele's employers at Coral Records wouldn't touch Holly and his \"hillbilly garbage,\" and neither would any of the big major labels. Finally Thiele convinced the powers that be at Coral that they just had to release \"That'll Be the Day,\" if only to keep him happy. The result was a monster hit that launched Holly's career and stayed on the charts for half a year.<br>\n The discovery of Buddy Holly is just one of the riveting stories Thiele has to tell in <b>What a Wonderful World</b>, a rollicking, no-holds-barred account of an unforgettable life in music, as told to Thiele's friend and collaborator Bob Golden. Over a still-ongoing career spanning six decades, Thiele has been a musician, dance band leader, publisher of one of the first jazz magazines in the world, a record producer, a DJ, a record label owner (several times), an A &amp; R man, and a songwriter. Indeed, Thiele's songwriting credits include the beloved Armstrong classic from which this book takes its title. From his precocious adolescence in Queens, where he began hosting his first radio jazz show at the tender age of 14, Thiele's career has been driven and defined by a genuine love and respect for great music. He tells how he discovered Jackie Wilson, jazz immortal Erroll Garner, Buddy Holly, and others, and takes readers behind-the-scenes to legendary recording sessions with Ellington, Armstrong, John Coltrane, Teresa Brewer (Thiele's wife of 26 years), Jack Kerouac, Steve Allen, the McGuire Sisters, Pat Boone, Frankie Laine, and many other artists. Thiele captures the free-wheeling, anything-could-happen-and-usually-did atmosphere of the jazz and pop recording worlds of decades gone by, and shares uproarious recollections of the heavy-hitting movers and shakers he has locked horns with over the years. Equally important, as an enduring and inventive force in American music, Thiele offers candid and perceptive observations on the increasing corporatization of the business he loves.<br>\n A fascinating journey from the days before rock 'n' roll to today, <b>What a Wonderful World</b> could only have been written by a true insider's insider. It will delight music lovers everywhere.\n\n\n                        The discovery of Buddy Holly is just one of the riveting stories Thiele tells in this rollicking, no-holds-barred account of an unforgettable life in music. Over a still-ongoing career spanning 60 years, Thiele's life has been driven and defined by a genuine love and respect for great music. This fascinating journey recounts his dealings with Jackie Wilson, Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, and many others. Photos.\n",

Rayford Steele's plane suddenly and mysteriously disappear. When Steele radios to London to report the situation, he discovers that the incident on his plane is not an isolated phenomenon but a worldwide occurrence. As Steele begins his search for answers, he learns that the Christ has come to take the faithful with Him in preparation for the coming apocalyptic battle between good and evil and that those who have been left behind must face seven dark and chaotic years in which they must decide to join the forces of Christ or the forces of Anti-Christ. Jenkins, writer-in-residence at Moody Press, and LaHaye (<i>A Nation Without a Conscience</i>, Tyndale, 1994) have written a gripping thriller that captures the anxiety and fear that interpretations of Revelation often inspire.

Many Prominent Writers Have Acknowledged Its Influence On Their Work; Students Of Intellectual History Consider It A Landmark; And The Generation Born Since World War Ii Considers Buber As One Of Its Prophets. The Need For A New English Translation Has Been Felt For Many Years. The Old Version Was Marred By Many Inaccuracies And Misunderstandings, And Its Recurrent Use Of The Archaic Thou Was Seriously Misleading. Now Professor Walter Kaufmann, A Distinguished Writer And Philosopher In His Own Right Who Was Close To Buber, Has Retranslated The Work At The Request Of Buber's Family. He Has Added A Wealth Of Informative Footnotes To Clarify Obscurities And Bring The Reader Closer To The Original, And He Has Written A Long Prologue That Opens Up New Perspectives On The Book And On Buber's Thought. This Volume Should Provide A New Basis For All Future Discussions Of Buber.",

Net Force, a computer security agency created by Congress, patrols the technological etherworld and those who hook into it. When the agency's director is assassinated, Deputy Director Alex Michaels suddenly finds himself in command. Diverted by the Chechen mastermind in Russia, Michaels and his forces are soon battling the New Mafia and an Irish assassin named \"The Selkie.\" Out in the field, the Special Forces carry advanced armor and weapons systems while joshing around in cartoonlike jargon.

    "synopsis": "The City, London&#39;s famous square mile, is home to merchant bankers and brokers and maintains its own police force. Chief Inspector Michael Haggerty asks his old friend Richard Jury to do him a favor: prove that the granddaughter of the brewing magnate Oliver Tynedale is an impostor and that the real granddaughter was killed, along with her mother, in the London blitz when a bomb hit a pub called the Blue Last. The pub&#39;s location was the last bomb site in London and only recently bought by a developer. Excavation turns up two skeletons those of a young woman and a very young child.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>Reading Grimes's 16th Richard Jury novel (The Case Has Altered, etc.) is like watching a good movie on TV constantly interrupted by commercials. The author used to produce well-crafted, atmospheric works with delightful characters, but in recent years they've become unnecessarily long, overpopulated with minor characters (including Melrose), who take up a lot of time while contributing little to the crime at hand. The premise here is promising enough: the bodies of a woman and an infant turn up in the last unredeveloped bomb site in London (a pub called the Blue Last), victims of the final heavy German bombing of WWII. The woman, identified as Alexandra Tyndale, was the daughter of a wealthy brewing magnate; the infant was the daughter of Alexandra's nanny. Or was the infant, in fact, Alexandra's daughter, whom the nanny swapped with her own child to make her heir to the Tyndale fortune? It's all quite Victorian. Called in by his friend DCI Mickey Haggerty to help on the case, Richard Jury soon finds himself involved with a murder that could be related. Two children, Grimes's usual pathologically precocious tots, enter the action, as does Melrose with a whole subplot of his own. Because of this excess baggage, the reader must wait impatiently for the mystery to resume. A far-fetched solution will satisfy only the author's staunchest fans. 8-city author tour. (Sept. 10) Forecast: Despite the weakness of this title, Grimes is impervious to negative criticism; like others in the series, this one should hit bestseller charts.

    "synopsis": "<P>In her 53rd bestselling novel, Danielle Steel explores how a single shattering moment can change lives forever. <i>The Kiss</i> is at once a moving testament to the fragility of life and a breathtaking story about the power of love to heal, to free, to transform, and to make broken spirits whole.<P>On a warm June evening, a red double-decker bus, full of pasengers, speeds down a London street. A few blocks away, a man and a woman climb into a limousine, reveling in a magical evening of dancing and champagne. As their driver pulls into an intersection, the couple shares their first, searching kiss. For a moment, etched in time, all stands still&#8212;until, in a flash of metal and glass, their limousine is struck at full speed, crushed under the bus's tremendous weight. And a long journey begins&#8212;toward healing, toward hope, toward dreams of an infinite future...<P>Isabelle Forrester is the exquisite wife of a prominent Parisian banker who has long since shut her out of his heart. For lonely years, Isabelle has lived a life of isolation, pouring her passions into caring for her desperately ill son, Teddy, and into making their Paris home as happy as possible for her teenage daughter, Sophie. Isabelle allows herself one secret pleasure&#58; a long-distance friendship by telephone with an American man, a Washington power broker who travels in the highest circles of politics and who, like Isabelle, is trapped in an empty marriage. To Bill Robinson, Isabelle is a godsend, a woman of extraordinary beauty and intellectual curiosity&#8212;a kindred spirit who touches him across the miles with her warmth and gentle empathy. Their relationship is a gift, a lifeline that sustains them both through the heartache of marriages they cannot leave and will not betray. Agreeing to meet for a few precious, innocent days in London, Isabelle and Bill find their friendship changing. Then, amidst the sudden crash of steel against steel, they are thrust onto a new path, a path fraught with pain but also with possibility.<P>Now, inside the cool, sterile wards of a London hospital, Isabelle and Bill cling to life, their bodies shattered almost beyond repair. In the days and weeks that follow, they slowly, painfully traverse a road to recovery littered with challenges of the body, spirit, and heart. Together, they must find the strength not only to embrace life again but to face what they have left behind. For Isabell, a loveless marriage turns into a brutal power struggle. For Bill, a time of healing exposes wounds that cut deeper than steel and realities that will test him to his core. For both, a tangle of changing relationships and the tragedy of another loss conspire to separate them once again. And this time they could lose each other forever.<P>In a novel that is as compelling as it is compassionate, Danielle Steel weaves a story of courage in the face of unimaginable loss. With the grace of a master storyteller, she explores the strength it takes to conquer our greatest fears, showing us how the toughest choices can yield the most unexpected rewards...and how the longest, most winding journeys can begin with a single kiss.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>First kisses are often explosive, but not all are quite as disaster-ridden as the one that propels Steel's latest romance. Isabelle Forrester, elegant and refined wife of cold and indifferent Paris-based banker Gordon Forrester, has spent most of her marriage caring for her desperately ill teenage son, Teddy. Isolated in her Paris home, Isabelle's only comfort is her long-distance friendship with millionaire Washington power broker Bill Robinson, also stuck in an empty marriage. Isabelle and Bill, kindred spirits satisfied with their chaste relationship, agree to meet for a few platonic days in London. Following an enchanting evening on the town, they head back to their hotel in Bill's limousine. As the couple share their first, probing kiss, their car is struck by a speeding, double-decker bus. The horrendous crash kills many and leaves both Isabelle and Bill in critical condition. The long and arduous road to recovery is filled with both physical and emotional pain as Bill must make decisions about his crumbling marriage and the future of his career, and Isabelle must confront bitter truths about her husband. From adjoining hospital beds, they pledge their love to one another, but then Isabelle heads back to Paris to tend her ailing son, and Bill returns to the States for a stay at a rehabilitation center where he hopes to regain use of his legs. Will Isabelle eventually leave her husband and reclaim her freedom? Will Bill ever walk again? Will the two soul mates ever be reunited? Despite the wacky unlikeliness of the bus-crash plot device and the his-and-her IVs, Steel pulls through with skillful plotting, steeping a gentle brew that will once again gratify her legions of fans.

Now he is risking it all for a death-row killer and an impossible case.Maximum Security Unit, Mississippi State Prison&#58;Sam Cayhall is a former Klansman and unrepentant racist now facing the death penalty for a fatal bombing in 1967. He has run out of chances -- except for one&#58; the young, liberal Chicago lawyer who just happens to be his grandson. While the executioners prepare the gas chamber, while the protesters gather and the TV cameras wait, Adam has only days, hours, minutes to save his client. For between the two men is a chasm of shame, family lies, and secrets -- including the one secret that could save Sam Cayhall's life...or cost Adam his.<h3>Walter Goodman</h3>So, let's begin with a word of reassurance. If you find your fingers racing through these 486 pages, it may signify merely that few of them demand close study. And as for putting the book down, I managed to do it without pain a score of times....Mr. Grisham has no pretensions to being a stylist. As with most other popular novels, the language does not bear inspection. Its main function is to deliver information, and you don't have to read absolutely every word, because all significant facts are repeated, usually more than once. Everything is made explicit; one's imagination is never imposed on. -- New York Times",

After a day spent staring at a computer monitor, think of the book as a kind of screen saver for your brain.&quot;<br>&#151;New York Times Book Review <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> Whether you're a computer whiz or a computer nerd, this tongue-in-cheek guide to computing by bestselling humorist Barry (Dave Barry's Complete Guide to Guys, etc.) has enough byte to keep you entertained. Designed to look like a user's manual, complete with section tabs and a mock glossary, it offers a wryly skeptical tour of the digital world with outrageously irreverent commentary on word-processing applications, software installation and use, Windows 95, Comdex trade shows, technical support services and much more. Computerphobes will instantly relate to Barry's spoof, which taps into the residual anxieties lurking even in computer sophisticates. (How to buy and set up a computer? \"Step One: Get Valium.\") Along with a brief history of computing from cave walls to virtual reality, Barry chats on the Internet, eavesdrops on a cybersex session and visits selected weird World Wide Web sites (\"Proof that civilization is doomed.\") Barry's nonstop humor is, perhaps necessarily, hit and miss, but he never loses sight of his big target and lets loose with enough volleys to remind us that, despite all the hype, a computer is just a machine \"that operates on simple principles that can be easily understood by anybody with some common sense, a little imagination, and an IQ of 750.\" Major ad/promo.

    "synopsis": "<I>\"If anything ever happens to me. . .<br />find Ann Rule and ask her to write my story.\"</I></B><br /><br />In perhaps the first true-crime book written at the victim's request, Ann Rule untangles a web of lies and brutality that culminated in the murder of Sheila Blackthorne Bellush -- a woman Rule never met, but whose shocking story she now chronicles with compassion, exacting detail, and unvarnished candor. Although happily ensconced in a loving second marriage, and a new family of quadruplets, Sheila never truly escaped the vicious enslavement of her ex-husband, multi-millionaire Allen Blackthorne, a handsome charmer -- and a violent, controlling sociopath who subjected Sheila to unthinkable abuse in their marriage, and terrorized her for a decade after their divorce. When Sheila was slain in her home, in the presence of her four toddlers, authorities raced to link the crime to Blackthorne, the man who vowed to monitor Sheila's every move in his obsessive quest for power and revenge. <h3>Maureen Corrigan</h3> As only the most adept crime stories do, <i>Every Breath You Take</i> manages to absolve its readers from the guilt of reading about such gruesomeness by engaging us in higher-minded, rubber-gloved investigations into the fault lines lurking in the human psyche and the American landscape. Rule digs up details about Allen Blackthorne's disturbing childhood and early adult life that form a case study of the classic American con man crossed with the more exotic strains of the sociopath. It is an affecting, tense and smart true-crime story. <br.&#151; <i>Washington Post Book World</i>",

He Strides Past Her Without A Glimmer Of Recognition Because She Barely Resembles The Woman He Is Expecting To See. Jim Had Last Seen Her When She Was 188 Pounds Heavier. What Follows Is One Of The Most Piercing Explorations Of The Limits And Promises Of A Body Since Lucy Grealy's Autobiography Of A Face.

She Joyfully Moves From Observer To Player, While Struggling To Enjoy The Freedom Her New Shape Has Given Her.

So when she sees the potential for a crime-solving spree, she jumps at the chance to moonlight as a detective.\nAccording to the evening news, local real estate agent Laurie Martin is missing and presumed dead. Marla and Al happened to have seen her dining with an attractive man several days before her disappearance. The man is Steve Mallard, loyal husband, doting father, and prime suspect. But Marla senses that something is not quite right. And her intuition has never let her down. Believing that there's more to the story than meets the eye, she takes matters into her own hands, vowing to get to the bottom of what's beginning to look like a very complex case.\n Al wants Marla to stay out of the way, fearing for her safety. He knows what's involved in detective work, and he's not sure she can hold her own as an investigator. But she won't be warned off this case. Their relationship has never been more fraught with complications—or sexual sizzle. With little warning or preparation, the two find themselves crisscrossing the United States in frantic pursuit of a remorseless criminal in an effort to prove Mallard's innocence. Finally Marla's found the excitement she's been looking for. With her, it's always been all or nothing.",

Outrageous and uproarious, flamboyant and serious as only the most perfect frivolity can be, James McCourt's entrancing send-up of the world of opera has been a cult classic for more than a quarter-century. This comic tribute to the love of art is a triumph of art and love by a contemporary American master.<h3>Library Journal</h3>Debuting in 1971, McCourt's comedic novel takes on the world of opera through title character Mawrdew Czgowchwz (pronounced \"Mardu Gorgeous\"), who finds herself both the darling of fans and the bane of other divas, who are less than welcoming and maternal to the new star. There are few opera parodies out there, so this should appeal to fans. Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information.",

For Nearly A Decade, The Shooting And Its Aftermath Reverberated Throughout This Hauntingly Beautiful City Of Moss-hung Oaks And Shaded Squares. John Berendt's Sharply Observed, Suspenseful, And Witty Narrative Reads Like A Thoroughly Engrossing Novel, And Yet It Is A Work Of Nonfiction. Berendt Skillfully Interweaves A Hugely Entertaining First-person Account Of Life In This Isolated Remnant Of The Old South With The Unpredictable Twists And Turns Of A Landmark Murder Case. It Is A Spellbinding Story Peopled By A Gallery Of Remarkable Characters: The Well-bred Society Ladies Of The Married Woman's Card Club; The Turbulent Young Redneck Gigolo; The Hapless Recluse Who Owns A Bottle Of Poison So Powerful It Could Kill Every Man, Woman, And Child In Savannah; The Aging And Profane Southern Belle Who Is The Soul Of Pampered Self-absorption; The Uproariously Funny Black Drag Queen; The Acerbic And Arrogant Antiques Dealer; The Sweet-talking, Piano-playing Con Artist; Young Blacks Dancing The Minuet At The Black Debutante Ball; And Minerva, The Voodoo Priestess Who Works Her Magic In The Graveyard At Midnight. These And Other Savannahians Act As A Greek Chorus, With Berendt Revealing The Alliances, Hostilities, And Intrigues That Thrive In A Town Where Everyone Knows Everyone Else. Midnight In The Garden Of Good And Evil: A Savannah Story Is A Sublime And Seductive Reading Experience. Brilliantly Conceived And Masterfully Written, This Enormously Engaging Portrait Of A Most Beguiling Southern City Is Certain To Become A Modern Classic.--book Jacket.

    "synopsis": "<br>Dimple Lala doesn't know what to think. Her parents are from India, and she's spent her whole life resisting their traditions. Then suddenly she gets to high school and everything Indian is trendy. To make matters worse, her parents arrange for her to meet a suitable boy. Of course it doesn't go well -- until Dimple goes to a club and finds him spinning a magical web . Suddenly the suitable boy is suitable because of his sheer unsuitability. Complications ensue. This is a funny, thoughtful story about finding your heart, finding your culture, and finding your place in America.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>An engrossing, personal account of the Indian-American experience through the eyes of a New Jersey teen, wrote PW in a boxed review. On one level, the book explores the growing pains, rebellious phases, peer pressures and first love experienced universally by teens. On a deeper level, it celebrates a harmonious blending of cultures as it traces one adolescent's bumpy trek toward self-actualization. Ages 13-up. (July) Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information.",

Smart, hardboiled and humorous, the novel taps our obsession with sex and death, sex and popular culture, sex and the written word, sex and pornography, sex and green M&amp;Ms, and, of course, the perennial sex and love.\n\"Great courage must account for such complete disregard of political correctness, and great sensitivity for such sadness.\"—Amanda Filipacchi, author of <i>Vapor</i> and <i>Nude Men</i>\n<b>Lauren Sanders</b> is a novelist and journalist who lives in New York City. She is co-editor of the anthology <i>Too Darn Hot: Writing About Sex Since Kinsey</i>, published by Persea Books in 1998.

Soon, a polite assassin arrives, with the dwarf in tow, demanding the book back. But Jill has already unloaded the valuable tome, and, as she values her life, immediately sets off to recover it. As an outrageous cast of thugs, sycophants, and central casting rejects join in the chase for the elusive volume and the special secret it contains, Jill finds herself cheated, kidnapped, drugged, tortured, and even forced to work as a movie extra. Twisted and subversive, Jen Banbury's debut is a mad, breathtaking romp through a hilariously dark vision of contemporary America.",

After years of matching IQs and test scores with less driven peers, they had two Harvard degrees apiece and were gunning for more. They'd plotted out a future in the most vaunted ivory tower of academe. But the dream had begun to disintegrate. Then, when their unborn son, Adam, was diagnosed with Down syndrome, doctors, advisers, and friends in the Harvard community warned them that if they decided to keep the baby, they would lose all hope of achieving their carefully crafted goals. Fortunately, that's exactly what happened. Expecting Adam is a poignant, challenging, and achingly funny chronicle of the extraordinary nine months of Martha's pregnancy. By the time Adam was born, Martha and John were propelled into a world in which they were forced to redefine everything of value to them, put all their faith in miracles, and trust that they could fly without a net. And it worked. <h3>Detroit Free Press</h3> Hooked me on the first page.",

    "synopsis": "In 1996 <I>The Notebook</I> by Nicholas Sparks captured the hearts and imaginations of readers around the world. It spent more than a year on the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller list and was the No. 1 bestselling hardcover fiction title of 1997. <I>Message in a Bottle</I>, Nicholas Sparks's eagerly anticipated second novel, proves that this author can uncork the magic again. The film industry caught on to the buzz immediately. Warner Brothers snapped up movie rights within 12 hours of submission, and Kevin Costner, Robin Wright, and Paul Newman will star in the film. The book is a heart-wrenching tale of self-discovery, renewal, and the courage it takes to love again. Teresa Osborne, a 36-year-old single mother, finds a bottle washed up on a Cape Cod beach. The scrolled-up message inside is a passionate love letter written by a heartbroken man named Garrett who is grieving over \"his darling Catherine.\" Teresa is so moved by the stranger's poignant words that she vows to find the penman and publishes the letter in her syndicated Boston newspaper column. Questions linger in her mind and heart: Who is Garrett? Who is Catherine? What is their story? And most importantly, why did this bottle find its way to her? Imagining that Garrett is the type of man she has always been seeking, Teresa sets out on an impulsive, hope-filled search. Her journey, her discovery, and the wisdom gained from this voyage of self-discovery changes her life forever. Love's unimaginable strength as well as its tremendous fragility echoes on each page of Sparks's newest gem.<h3>Library Journal</h3>Sparks, who coauthored the self-help parable <i>Wokini</i> (Random, 1994), weighs in with a romantic novel that will receive a substantial marketing push.",

This volume, filled with the experience and techniques of ten of today's finest oil painters, shows you how to discover and paint your own successful paintings, covering everything from the importance of brush selection to capturing the color nuances of a collapsing wave.\nTogether these artists offer a treasury of instruction in oil technique: Charles Reid shows you how to handle an oil brush with dexterity and how to make handling and mixing color simple. Wendon Blake, George Cherepov, Paul Strisik, and Richard Schmid teach you how to capture the magnificence of a full landscape, and the more subtle characteristics of the countryside; Foster Caddell shows you how to overcome elementary errors in composition, balance of values and especially how to handle color in the landscape; E. John Robinson demonstrates how to capture the color and awesome power in the sea and shore; Ken Davies teaches you how to render sharp focus still lifes in oil; and John Howard Sanden, Charles Pfahl and Jane Corsellis show you how to paint the human portrait and figure, perhaps the most intriguing painting subject of all.\nThe book is divided into seven sections: oil Brushwork, handling color, landscapes, color in landscapes, seascapes, sharp focus, and figures and portraits. Each section's full-color step-by-step demonstrations clearly illustrate how the artists achieve their striking results, and how you can too.\nProfusely illustrated and entirely in color, <i>Oil Painting Techniques</i> is required reading for the amateur or intermediate oil painter who wants to develop his skill in this medium.\n\n\n                        Ten top artists show how to master the art of mixing colors and brushstrokes.\n",

The novel evokes an age when three major religions maintained an uneasy coexistence on the island of Britain. Eilan, a daughter of goddess-worshiping druids, and Gaius Marcellius, a half-British Roman, live for the coming of a legendary future king to unite the warring islanders. Bradley envisions the \"old religion'' as a refreshing blend of classic and revisionist concepts, adding a distinct flavor to her seamless weave of history and myth. Most libraries will want this for their fantasy collections. Previewed in Prepub Alert, LJ 12/93.",

I don't suppose you'd care to house-sit for a while?\"<P>Thus begins the irresistible story of two fixer-uppers-an old house and a young woman-and their efforts to recapture their true luster.<P>When Hetty Longden, freshly dumped and brokenhearted, agrees to look after her great-uncle's long-abandoned mansion in the British countryside, she's at something of a lifetime low. With no job, no lover, no prospects, and no particular talent for resuscitating crumbling estates, she hope for nothing more than some good old-fashioned escape. What she finds includes a cast of quirky an ever-present neighbors, a couple of SNAGs (Sensitive New Age Guys), some very humorless bank officials, two disarming little canines, one gracious, dilapidated, romantic old house, and, just maybe, enough elbow grease to polish everything up again.<P>A British bestseller that's as inviting as an elegant old house full of unexplored rooms (after a good scrubbing-down, of course), <i>Stately Pursuits </i>is the funniest, smartest, and warmest read of the season.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>Cheery, good-natured and predictable, British writer Fforde's latest stylish romance (after Wild Designs) relates the story of a young, freshly jilted and heartbroken protagonist, Hetty Longden, who gets more than she bargained for when she agrees to house-sit for her ailing elderly uncle Samuel while he is hospitalized. Hetty finds Courtbridge, Samuel's stately manor home, in desperate need of renovation; moreover, Samuel is deeply in debt. Even more threatening than loan officers, though, is Connor Barrabin, Samuel's gruff and irascible heir (known as \"Conan the Barbarian\" to locals), who intends to raze the house and erect a theme park on the property as soon as Courtbridge comes into his possession. Hetty, like the other residents of the small English village, is horrified by the potential loss of this piece of their national heritage and is determined instead to fix up the stately home and open it to the paying public for tours and parties. Rallying the help of the multitalented townsfolk and the local Brownie troop, plucky Hetty gets the house in shape, meanwhile managing to rebuild her shattered confidence and make some wonderful new friends. Also, not surprisingly, Hetty finds a sensitive and loving man beneath Connor's abrasive exterior, and the two fall in love despite their opposing views about the fate of the house. Although the plot isn't terribly imaginative, the novel has a warm and fuzzy charm, some nice comic scenes and the usual romantic contretemps. (July)",

When reporter Meghan Collins sees the sheet-wrapped corpse in a New York City hospital, she feels as if she's staring into her own face. And Meghan has troubles enough already without this bizarre experience. Nine months ago, her much-loved father's car spun off a New York bridge. Now, investigators are saying that there's no trace of his car in the river, and they suspect he faked his own death. With frightening speed, links start to appear between Meghan's father and her dead lookalike. Meghan may be in danger herself, but she's determined to find the truth to the mystery. In a nightmare journey spiraling from New York to Connecticut to Arizona, Meghan finds that the truth can sometimes be deadly.\n\n\n                        The author whose phenomenal blockbusters have sold more than 25 million copies in the U.S. writes a relentlessly terrifying novel about a reporter dragged into her family's hidden past--a chilling web of secrets and betrayals where nothing is as it seems, and the truth may be too devastating to pursue.\n",

    "synopsis": "<P>A New York City magazine editor and novelist returns home to the South when her closest childhood friend falls ill&#151;and finds herself forced to choose between pursuing her career and rekindling her relationship with the man she has long considered the love of her life. NPR sponsorship.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>Fans who have become a bit tired of the inbred, eccentric cast of characters who generally inhabit Gilchrist's short stories and novels will find the protagonist of this novel to be refreshingly new psychological territory. At 52, Sarah Conley is a successful journalist (a senior editor at Time) and an NBA winner (she wrote a roman clef that antagonized the boon companions of her youth). Bright, independent and focused, Sarah has ruthlessly pursued fulfillment as a writer. She divorced after six years of an early marriage and as a result lost custody of her son (whose paternity is in doubt) to her ex-husband, who is the brother of the man Sarah has always loved, Jack McAllenwho married Sarah's best friend, Eugenie Moore. Now Jack calls Sarah to tell her that Eugenie is dying. Sarah flies to Nashville, where she sees Eugenie one last time and feels again the passion for Jack that derailed her life once before. When she goes to Paris to write a screenplay and Jack pursues her, Sarah fears that she must make a choice between her high-powered career and the needs of her heart. It is here that Sarah may begin to grate on readers: she is just too smart, good-looking, sexy and successful, and even her dilemma lacks the drama to make her completely appealing. On the positive side, the narrative is energized by Gilchrist's comments on contemporary life, including some swipes at ethics at Time and in the movie industry. The dynamics of relationships, always her forte, have a new depth as her characters look back on the self-centered optimism of youth from the vantage point of middle-age, having become aware of their mortality, the diminishing opportunities for love and the compromises that occur in every life, no matter how fortunate. The quirky cadences of Gilchrist's prose and her witty, dialogue (though her characters talk like no one else except other Gilchrist characters) are present here in abundance. But the most salient aspect of this novel is its recognition that the past can't be revoked and the future will arrive no matter what one decides. (Sept.)",

There Is No Comparable, Succinct Work On This Nation's Greatest President. The Last Best Hope Of Earth Vividly Recaptures The Central Place Of Politics In Lincoln's Life. In Illinois, Lincoln Was An Established And Prosperous Lawyer, Married To A Refined And Educated Southern Belle, And The Father Of Four Boys. Throughout His Life, However, Politics Remained His First Love. In Neely's Depiction Of Lincoln, Power Was Never Sought For Its Own Sake. Having Triumphed Over The Hardscrabble Circumstances Of His Youth In Kentucky And Indiana, Lincoln, Early In His Political Career, Tied His Ambition To The Search For Solutions To The Economic Underdevelopment Of The American West. And In The Last Eleven Years Of His Life, Lincoln's Political Ambitions Became Yoked To A Fierce Nationalism And A Keen Moral Purpose - The Preservation Of The Union And The Demise Of Slavery. Lincoln Could Not Remember A Time When He Did Not Hate Slavery, Or Revere The Federal System. He Made His Position Clear In The Decade Leading Up To His Presidential Election Campaign, And A Civil War Erupted. Through Neely's Eyes We See The Growth Of This President's Advanced Ideas About Military Strategy, Despite Their Price In Blood; His Husbanding Of The Resources Of The Home Front, Regardless Of Its Cost In National Treasure; And His Complex Defense Of The Constitution, Notwithstanding A Momentary Loss Of Civil Liberties. We Also See Lincoln's Steadfast Dedication To The Emancipation Proclamation, While The Fate Of The Republic And The Future Of Four Million Black Americans Hung In The Balance. Richly Illustrated, Nuanced And Accessible, Written With Attention To The Age In Which Lincoln Lived, Yet Ever Alert To Universal Moral Questions, This Is A Portrait Of Lincoln As An Extraordinary Man In His Own Time And Ours.--book Jacket.

    "synopsis": "Will is thirty-six and doesn't really want children. Why does it bother people that he lives so happily alone in a fashionable, Lego-free flat, with massive speakers and a mammoth record collection, hardwood floors, and an expensive cream-colored rug that no kid has ever thrown up on? Then Will meets Angie. He's never been out with anyone who was a mom. And it has to be said that Angie's long blond hair and big blue eyes are not irrelevant to Will's reassessment of his attitude toward children. Then it dawns on Will that maybe Angie goes out with him because of the children. That maybe children democratize beautiful, single women. That single mothers -- bright, attractive, available women - were all over London ... Marcus is twelve and he knows he's weird. It was all his mother's fault, Marcus figured. She was the one who made him listen to Joni Mitchell instead of Nirvana, and read books instead of play on his Gameboy. Then Marcus meets Will. Will belongs to his mother's SPAT group (Single Parents, Alone Together), and Will is cool. Marcus needs someone who knows what kind of sneakers he should wear, and who Kurt Cobain is. And Marcus's mother needs a husband. They could all move in together! Marcus and his mother, Will and his son, Ned. Then Marcus follows Will home to his flat, where there are no toys or diapers, no second bedroom, even -- and certainly no Ned. This was valuable stuff. If Marcus went home and told his mother about this right away, that would be the end of it. But something tells Marcus that he should hang on to this information until he knows what it's worth.<h3>Hal Espen</h3>Hornby...combines a skilled, intuitive appreciation for the rigors of comic structure with highly original insights about the way the enchantments of popular culture insinuate themselves into middle-class notions of romance. &#151;<I>The New York Times Book Review</i>",

Knowing she will never run again once her feet are bound, Ailin rebels and refuses to follow this torturous tradition. <P>As a result, however, the family of her intended husband breaks their marriage agreement. And as she enters adolescence, Ailin finds that her family is no longer willing to support her.

A world of mists and forests, of ancient magics, mythical beings, ageless bards, and restless evil. Now, with their friends and enemies alike&#151;Blue, the Biker; Keiran, the folk musician, the Inspector from the RMCP, and the mysterious Tom Hengy&#151;Sara and Jamie are drawn into this enchanted land through the portals of Tamson House, that sprawling downtown edifice that straddles two worlds. Sweeping from ancient Wales to the streets of Ottawa today, <i>Moonheart</i> will enchant you with its tale of this world and the other one at the very edge of sight ... and of the unforgettable people caught up in the affairs of both.<h3>Gale Research</h3>Reviewing <I>Moonheart</I> for the Toronto <I>Globe and Mail, </I> Douglas Hill described it as \"an ambitious hybrid\" that combines traditional fantasy elements with those of horror, suspense, and romance in a modern setting in Ottawa, Ontario. Strange events at an Ottawa mansion prove to be linked to a long-standing battle between good and evil forces, and modern weaponry and ancient spells come together in the climax. Observed the critic, \"De Lint sustains his balance between ordinary reality and legend with skill.\"",

Delia Byrd is headed back to Cayro, Georgia, and for the first time in years, she knows what she wants - the two daughters she left behind a lifetime ago.\nCayro, Georgia, is a world of truck farms and convenience stores, biscuit franchises and deep rooted Baptism. And, beneath this surface, caves: lost caves, known caves; caves called \"Little Mouth\" and \"Paula's Lost\"; caves where color explodes in the dark and where people have died and been buried; caves waiting to be mapped and explored. Cayro, with its red earth and kudzu, is the only terrain Clint Windsor, the man Delia ran from, and the two girls, Amanda and Dede, have ever known. And when Delia and Cissy reach Cayro, the past unfurls into the present, and Cayro, Georgia, becomes a more complicated place than any of them could have imagined.",

In these twenty never-before-published essays, some of the keenest minds of our time ask the big, tantalizing questions&#58; Where might we be if history had not unfolded the way it did? Why, how, and when was our fortune made real? The answers are surprising, sometimes frightening, and always entertaining.. \"In addition to the essays, fifteen sidebars by such authors as Caleb Carr, Tom Wicker, David Fromkin, and Ted Morgan illuminate in brief other world-changing episodes. <h3>Chronicles of High Education</h3> If rain, wind, and fog had not aided the Continental Army's desperate escape across the East River one night in August 1776, would we now be singing \"God Save the Queen\" at ball games? <P>For Robert Cowley thinks that \"counterfactuals,\" scenarios of how the course of history might have changed if some key event had unfolded differently. So he enticed 34 historians to contribute to a new book of essays: What If? The World's Foremost Military Historians Imagine What Might Have Been.",

But the pilot manages to land the plane. . . .<P>At a moment when the issue of safety and death in the skies is paramount in the public mind, a lethal midair disaster aboard a commercial twin-jet airliner bound from Hong Kong to Denver triggers a pressured and frantic investigation.<P>AIRFRAME is nonstop reading&#58; the extraordinary mixture of super suspense and authentic information on a subject of compelling interest that has been a Crichton landmark since The Andromeda Strain.<h3>Mary Elizabeth Williams</h3><P>Internal Memo <P>Time Warner Disney Dreamworks Fox-Murdoch Turner Ventures, Inc. <P>From: Ken Sprenkel, CEO <P>To: Michael Wilson, Senior VP, Production <P>I've just looked at the first galleys of <i>Airframe</i>, and I'm pleased to announce that Mike has gone and done it again. <i>Airframe</i> is going to be the biggest-grossing film of 1998. (The sequel to Mikey's <i>Jurassic Park</i> comes out in '97, right? Har har.) Let's just keep our fingers crossed that the FAA doesn't do anything stupid to step up air safety any time soon - a big disaster, timed to the release of the film, would be <i>boffo</i>. <P>The story's great - a charter airline from Hong Kong (political statement? may need to rework) gets into some fatal turbulence (fatal turbulence! how does Crich come up with them?), and lands with a couple of passengers who've permanently cashed in their frequent flier miles. Of course this happens the same week the plane's American manufacturer is about to close a big sale with China - a sale that might or might not cost those hard-working union Yanks their jobs. What's right? What's wrong? Who's at fault for the disaster? (Don't worry - it isn't too morally ambiguous for the average Joe). <P>I see either Sharon or Michelle in the lead as Casey, the gutsy but feminine quality control investigator. Michael Douglas was born to play the nefarious Norton Aircraft CEO John Marder. We're talking Oscar here. Plus there's meaty roles for the ambitious, backstabbing underling (get McConaughey's agent on the phone TODAY), and the scandal digging TV producer (I think either Gwyneth or Liv here, your thoughts?). <P>Obviously, we'll have to gut those pages and pages of aviation terminology - BOR-ing! Mike can get so heavy-handed with that stuff. Which reminds me, let's try to negotiate him down on the fee for writing the screenplay. I mean, frankly, he's already done it. Read the book, you'll see. If he won't play ball, we'll threaten to get Eszterhas to tweak it. -- <i>Salon</i>",

When Detective Chief Superintendent William Vetch arrests Miss Parchman two weeks later, he discovers a second tragedy&#58; the key to the Valentine's Day massacre hidden within a private humiliation Eunice Parchman has guarded all her life.&#160;&#160;A brilliant rendering of character, motive, and the heady discovery of truth, <b>A Judgement in Stone</b> is among Ruth Rendell's finest psychological thrillers. <h3>Library Journal</h3> Published in 1976 and 1977, respectively, these are fairly typical of Rendell's popular psychological thrillers. Demon presents a researcher studying psychopathic personalities who doesn't recognize that his seemingly shy, harmless neighbor is a total nut job.

    "synopsis": "<P>From Longman&#39;s Cultural Editions series, <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, edited by Alison Booth, presents Emily Bronte&rsquo;s haunting, brilliant novel freshly edited, smartly annotated, and illuminated by various contexts. This illustrated edition is unique in locating <i>Wuthering Heights </i>in its region as well as period, while it follows every phase of the Bront&euml; renown, from tourism to adaptations, from early reviews to recent critical trends.<h3>Children's Literature</h3>More twisted and thorny that the branches of a wild rose, Heathcliff's dark, passionate obsessions consume him&#151;and everyone who crosses his path. Considered one of the greatest works of English literature ever written, this gothic novel's bleak, destructive love story set against the desolate backdrop of England's Yorkshire moors has, for over 150 years, ensnared readers with its complexities, unreliable narrators and characters nearly beyond belief in their harshness. This affordable edition in the Puffin Classics line includes many helpful features that make the story more easily understood by modern readers, including a family tree, an annotated \"Who's Who\" to distinguish each character's role, an author profile, and two introductions. The first introduction is by S. E. Hinton, author of <I>The Outsiders</I>, and the second is by Charlotte Bronte, who edited the 1850 edition. Astute teachers will capitalize on the glimpse of the time period provided by a \"Biographical Notice of Ellis and Acton Bell,\" which, though slightly confusing, ultimately reveals that all of the Brontes works were originally published under the gender-neutral pseudonyms Acton, Ellis, and Currer Bell. In this notice, penned after the death of her author-sisters Anne & Emily, Charlotte clears what was apparently a great mystery at the time: that Anne was Acton, Emily was Ellis, and she was Currer. This could be used as a springboard into discussions of social customs of the time and how they impacted both the author's life and the novel she wrote. This edition also includes some thought questions and suggested activities based on the novel. Best of all, however, is the book's design. It fits perfectly in one's hands and has easy-to-read type.

    "synopsis": "When the rich, successful husband of a beautiful New York actress mysteriously disappears, she plunges into a desperate search to find him... and into a menacing web of secrets, deception, and danger. Once again Judith McNaught, author of the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Night Whispers,</i> crafts a thrilling tale filled with unrelenting suspense, unforgettable characters, and powerful undercurrents of greed, ambition, and desire.  Leigh Kendall reveled in her stellar Broadway acting career and in her marriage to Logan Manning, scion of an old New York family. When her husband finds an old country cottage, he decides to build their dream house and surprise Leigh with her first view of the mountain property. After a Sunday night performance, Leigh heads north to join him, and into a blinding blizzard. Lost and alone, she's deliberately run off the road. When she awakes in the local hospital, seriously injured, she asks for her husband. The police arrive to inform her that he has myteriously disappeared, and Leigh, although obviously distraught, becomes the focus of their suspicions.  The more she discovers about her husband and his business affairs, the less she realizes she knew about Logan Manning, and the more terrified she becomes. Now, with no one to help her, she is heading deeper and deeper into unknown territory... where friends and enemies are impossible to distinguish, and where the truth becomes the most terrifying weapon of all. <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>Night Whispers, McNaught's first romantic suspense novel (after a host of historicals), hit the charts hard, and this solid follow-up looks to do the same. Legendary stage actress Leigh Kendall is starring in a Broadway play, lives in a fabulous apartment and adores her husband, Logan Manning, a handsome, rich and virile businessman. After an afternoon performance, she's off to meet Logan in their country cabin, where he's promised an evening of lust and love in front of a roaring fire. Her life changes forever when she drives over an embankment in a snowstorm and barely escapes death. After waking up bruised and battered in the hospital, she finds Logan missing, her rival performing her part in the play, a creepy stalker sending expensive flowers and the evil Michael Valente, a business acquaintance of her husband's, being suspiciously attentive. Leigh checks out of the hospital and begins a frantic search for Logan aided by a team of detectives from the NYPD. As the search intensifies, she begins to learn secrets that expose her golden marriage as a fraud and her husband as a serial cheater. A romantic subplot features two of the cops investigating her case, the chiseled Lt. Mitchell McCord and rookie detective Samantha Littleton, who partner up in more ways than one. Leigh proves to be a stalwart if privileged heroine who finds a knight in shining armor in an unexpected corner of her past. The suspense is not terribly suspenseful, and several plot threads go uncollected, but romance is McNaught's bread and butter and she serves it up in abundance. (Feb.) Forecast: Some of McNaught's fans are not happy with her switch from historical romance to contemporaries, but sales have yet to dip-expect this to move fast.

Some make a small but deep impression, like a kid from your second grade class who shows up in your dream every three years. Others walk in and break your heart. You remember them every day. Very few people, maybe one, maybe none, stay with you for the long run. It's a kind of miracle if someone's with you for the long run. A kind of miracle...\"</b></blockquote>\nFrom the award-winning author of the acclaimed short story collection <b>Director of the World</b> comes this stunning debut novel—a charmingly poignant, razor sharp tale of two sisters and the depths and consequences of love that is reminiscent of the works of Anne Tyler, Louise Erdrich, and Barbara Kingsolver.\nGladys and Ivy are sisters, reluctant best friends who have depended upon each other through a shared lifetime marked by grief and loss, including the untimely deaths of Gladys's two children and the end of her passionate yet troubled marriage. While bonded by love and loneliness, the sisters remain divided by a wall of silence and pain that prevents Gladys from accepting the solace Ivy desperately needs to give.\nThen one late April day, the pattern of their quiet lives is suddenly ruptured when a dark-eyes young woman with a mysterious past arrives on their doorstep. Quickly befriending Gladys, the intriguing Raelene convinces her to escape on a cross-country jaunt that will become a journey of discovery. Left to contend with the loss of her sister—and a surprise visit from Gladys's estranged husband—Ivy too will contemplate the frayed tapestry of her life and confront emotions long denied.\nFor Ivy and Gladys, however, personal transformation has just begun. Eventually reunited, the two must face searing truths about themselves, their past, and their relationship—soulful revelations that will ultimately bring them closer or hopelessly keep them apart.\nRich in character, language, and emotion, <b>One Heart</b> is a powerful, moving tale of family, friendship, forgiveness, and redemption—a remarkable achievement from an exquisitely talented new writer.",

    "synopsis": "Every once in a while a thriller comes along that stretches the limits of the genre and takes readers places they have never been before. There are the fears we hide deep inside where the real world isn't supposed to touch us. In the night - any night - these fears, terrors, and emotions can drive us to commit the darkest sins. Now there is an author who knows these secrets and has woven them into a relentlessly compelling thriller, a book of such page-turning power that it is time to declare there is a new modern master of suspense - and her name is Tami Hoag. Deer Lake is a small Minnesota town where people know their neighbors and crime is something that happens on the evening news. But the illusion of safety is shattered when eight-year-old Josh Kirkwood disappears from a hockey rink as he waits for his mother to pick him up after practice. The only thing the police find is his duffel bag with a note stuffed inside: ignorance is not innocence but SIN. With each passing hour the search for Josh takes on a more ominous intensity. For Megan O'Malley, the new regional officer of the state criminal investigative unit, it is the first test of whether she can cut it in the all-male world of local cops. For police chief Mitch Holt, it is a frightening reminder of the big city crime that devastated his life before he fled to Deer Lake. All the while someone watches, preparing the next move in a deadly game to which only he knows the rules, a game of terrifying clues leading to one final twist of the trail - and a snare set by a warped mind as black as death, as guilty as sin....",

    "synopsis": "<P><b>His Victims. . .</b><P>A woman is frantic as she awakens in a dark, closed space. From above her comes the muffled sound of cruel laughter, followed by the hard splatter of dirt. Pure terror takes over as she realizes she's being burie<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>Slowly waking from a drugged sleep, a woman realizes she's not in her own bed but in a closed coffin, lying on top of a cold, reeking dead body. Thuds resonate on the lid-dirt and stones being shoveled on top-bringing the sure knowledge she's being buried alive. From this bone-chilling, if melodramatic, opening image, Jackson skillfully crafts a horrific thriller about an elusive serial killer dubbed The Grave Robber. Seeing the high-profile murders as her ticket out of small-town Savannah, ambitious reporter Nikki Gillette latches onto the case and onto lead investigator Pierce Reed. Tough-guy police detective Pierce initially sees Nikki's dogged investigations as a mere irritant-until evidence turns up indicating that the killer may see Nikki as his prey. Meanwhile, tension and unease mount for Nikki as secret ties among the attractive Pierce, whom she may be falling for, the killer and the victims start coming to light. As in Jackson's previous offering, The Night Before, this psychological thriller has a beautifully conceived plot full of unexpected twists and provocative misleads, as well as sophisticated character development. Not even the sadistic murderer is one-dimensionally evil, and the protagonists display delicious depths. (Mar.) Forecast: Jackson's last few books fell just shy of the New York Times's top 10, but this book, supported as it is by a multicity author tour and print and radio advertising, has a good chance of scoring a higher placement.

The region has been the scene of violent confrontations between settlers and the original natives, an emotional struggle for independence, a bitter civil war, and, most recently, a transformation into one of the country's finest examples of historic restoration.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nSome parapsychologists believe that spirits can be awakened by a sudden flurry of activity. With so much activity occurring throughout the area's history, it is little wonder that there are so many documented sightings of ghosts in this triangle.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nIn this book, Jackie Behrend brings together thirty-seven of the region's most intriguing spirits. From Williamsburg come tales about the Wagon of Death, which can still be heard rolling down Nicholson Street as it brings prisoners to the gallows; the colonial celebrations that continue at the Raleigh Tavern; the residential area where all is quiet except for the ghosts still fighting the Revolutionary War; and the ongoing wedding that brings men form both sides of the Civil War together. From Yorktown come stories about the sounds that emanate from the cave where Lord Cornwallis hid during the town's siege during 1781; the mournful tune that is heard on Surrender Field; and the melancholy feeling that overcomes people retracing the path where slaves were once marched. From Jamestown comes the tale of a deserted lover's angry ghost who still haunts the banks of the James River. From Carter's Grove comes the story of a slave who still searches Old Country Road for his lost family.<br>\n\n<br>\n\nJust as you can step back in time by visiting the restored settlements of the historic triangle, you can now revisit the past through the stories about the ghostly spirits who haunt Williamsburg, Yorktown, and Jamestown.",

It is a perfect evening -- until a band of gun-wielding terrorists breaks in through the air-conditioning vents and takes the entire party hostage. But what begins as a panicked, life-threatening scenario slowly evolves into something quite different, as terrorists and hostages forge unexpected bonds and people from different countries and continents become compatriots. Without the demands of the world to shape their days, life on the inside becomes more beautiful than anything they had ever known before. At once riveting and impassioned, the narrative becomes a moving exploration of how people communicate when music is the only common language. Friendship, compassion, and the chance for great love lead the characters to forget the real danger that has been set in motion and cannot be stopped.<h3>Madison Smartt Bell</h3><I>Bel Canto</I> has all the qualities one has come to expect from a classic Ann Patchett novel&#58; grace, beauty, elegance, and magic.",

The money was good and getting better; a partnership was three years away. He was a rising star with no time to waste, no time to stop, no time to toss a few coins into the cups of panhandlers. No time for a conscience. But a violent encounter with a homeless man stopped him cold. Michael survived; his assailant did not. Who was this man? Michael did some digging, and learned that he was a mentally ill veteran who'd been in and out of shelters for many years. Then Michael dug a little deeper, and found a dirty secret, and the secret involved Drake & Sweeney.<h3>People Magazine</h3>Enough plot zigzags to keep readers happily hooked.",

But, thanks to the efforts of three men, Seabiscuit became one of the most spectacular performers in sports history. The rags-to-riches horse emerged as an American cultural icon, drawing an immense following and becoming the single biggest newsmaker of 1938 -- receiving more coverage than FDR or Hitler. Laura Hillenbrand beautifully renders this story of one horse's journey from also-ran to national luminary.\n\n                        <b>Second-place winner of Barnes &amp; Noble's 2001 <a href=\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/awards/bndiscover.asp?sLinkPrefix\">Discover Great New Writers Award</a> for Nonfiction</b>\n",

    "synopsis": "History, hot and sizzling, with passion burning and adventure in every port -- these are the hallmarks of any, Kathleen Woodiwiss novel! The beloved author of the groundbreaking <i> The Flame and the Flower</i> has penned the long-awaited sequel to that breathtaking story of love at sea with <i>The Elusive Flame</i>. Woodiwiss is a better writer now than she was the first time around, and her story soars magnificently. Where <i>The Flame and the Flower</i> ends, the new one begins, but this time the masculine hero is Beau Birmingham, son of Captain Brandon Birmingham and the beautiful Heather Simmons.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>Romance novelist Woodiwiss's sequel to her perennial bestseller The Flame and the Flower (1972) continues the story of Heather and Brandon Birmingham's son, Beauregard. Set in 1825 England and the Carolinas, it's a bit more politically correct than the earlier book. Notorious for beginning her stories with the rape of the heroine by the hero, Woodiwiss nods to current sensibilities by having the heroine almost raped by the hero, but here Beau is excused because he's feverish and delirious, and also because plucky Cerynise Edlyn Kendall doesn't seem to mind the experience. Beau's a dashing sea captain (as was his sire, Brandon), and Cerynise is an orphan thrown out on the mean London streets by the villain who usurped her guardian's wealth. (Readers will remember that Beau's mother, Heather, was also an orphan thrown out on the London streets.) In standard Woodiwiss form, the hero and heroine, though burning with lust for each other, are separated by willfulness and misunderstanding. Cerynise's pregnancy brings hot hunk Beau to heel, and they wed--an almost mirror image of Brandon and Heather's relationship. A vicious pair of London villains and an equally vicious trio of villains in Charleston add a new twist to the story and allow Woodiwiss to invent a melodramatic climax in a storm-buffeted house. The prose is stilted, the plot hackneyed and both dialogue and settings pay little attention to historical accuracy. (Sept.)",

    "synopsis": "In her first book since the cultural phenomenon Sex and the City, Candace Bushnell triumphantly returned with the national best-seller Four Blondes, which The New York Times says chronicles the glittering lives of semicelebrities, social aspirants, and moneyed folk ... [with] withering precision. Now her collection of novellas is available in paperback -- just in time to pack in your handbag for that summer weekend getaway to the Hamptons or that romantic rendezvous on Martha's Vineyard. Four Blondes tells the stories of four women facing up to the limitations of their rapidly approaching middle age in an era that worships youth. From the former It-girl heroine of Nice N'Easy, who each summer looks for a rich man who'll provide her with a house in the Hamptons, to the writer-narrator of Single Process, who goes to London on a hunt for love and a good magazine story, Bushnell brings to life contemporary women in search of something more -- when the world is pushing for them to settle for less. Sexy, funny, and wonderfully lush with gossip and scandal, Four Blondes will keep you turning pages long into the night.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>The author whose name is synonymous with her novel Sex and the City weighs in again with four loosely linked tales that form a sexually charged and withering analysis of how New York's--and London's--women work feverishly at their relationships, meanwhile trying desperately to make their names. In the first chapter, the bluntly scheming, semisuccessful model Janey Wilcox is in her 10th year of charming powerful, rich men into installing her in their Hamptons homes for the summer. The mutual benefits are obvious: the moguls get a gorgeous sex kitten to display and bed, while she summers in high style. When this arrangement leads to a few humiliating encounters, however, Janey tries her hand at screenwriting and attempts real estate school, but eventually she finds her fortune in a more realistic endeavor: a lucrative lingerie modeling contract. The next story features Winnie, a successful columnist married to a mediocre literary journalist. The victims of relentless ambition and disappointment, they lash one another with insults, each finding their only solace in one-night stands. The third tale is the paranoid confession of Cecelia, who wants to be normal and pops pills to mitigate her fear of being nothing without a man. The last blonde is an unnamed 40-year-old journalist who, disillusioned with Manhattan males, travels to London on a magazine assignment to compare English and American men's attitudes about sex. The Brit banter revolves entirely around sexual technique and penis size, but manages to be entertaining. Mostly, the novel is New York-centric, focused on the obsessions of desperate people and replete with glittering details to satisfy the most exacting fashionista. Though superficial, these characters' envy and spite rises from their fear of mortality, of dying without having left their mark. Mercilessly satirical, Bushnell's scathing insights and razor wit are laced with an understanding of this universal human fear, and they inspire fear and pity in the reader.

    "synopsis": "The abduction of eight-year-old Josh Kirkwood sent small-town Deer Lake, Minnesota, into a tailspin. Even now, after the arrest of a suspect and the return of the boy, fear maintains its grip and questions linger. What happened to Josh in the hands of his kidnapper? Why has he not spoken a word since his return, not even to name his abductor? Is the nightmare over or just beginning? Assistant County Attorney Ellen North knows her assignment to the Kirkwood case has landed her in the hot seat - a position she thought she'd left behind in the crime-choked Minneapolis court system. But politics and ulterior motives abound even in rural Park County. And if there was any hope of controlling the media frenzy, it is shattered when Ellen's boss grants full access of the case to bestselling true-crime writer Jay Butler Brooks. Now, as Ellen prepares for the trial of her career with an ex-lover arguing for the defense, her every move will be shadowed by Brooks, a man as mysterious as the case itself. All the while, another shadow follows Ellen with deadly intent. It is a soul-chilling whispered voice on the telephone. A knife-etched obscenity on the door of her car. The finger on the trigger of an apparent suicide...\n\n                        Night Sins, Hoag's impressive hardcover debut, revealed her to be a masterful spinner of spine-chilling thrills. Her new novel continues that bestselling momentum, bringing terror to a whole new level. As prosecutor Ellen North prepares her case against a kidnapper, she faces a sensation-driven press corps, political maneuvering, and her ex-lover as attorney for the defense.\n",

    "synopsis": "When Dr. Blake Hunter discovers Casey Edwards wandering along a Sweetwater, Georgia road, she's a woman without a past, her memory stripped of the terrifying events that shattered her innocence a decade ago. The scrap of paper she clutches in her hand bears the address to Swan House, the magnificent mansion where Casey's mother lives with her mysteriously ailing husband. But \"home\" turns out to be anything but a safe haven...  A near-fatal hit-and-run; neighbors who won't look her in the eye; a sinister man whispering with her mother behind closed doors...each disturbing experience makes Casey more determined to untangle the web of secrets that threaten her future. But someone wants Casey out of the way before she remembers too much. It will take the strength she's always had -- and the love she's just found -- to save her life....<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>There's enough melodrama in Michaels's newest offering (after No Place Like Home) to quench the thirst of soap opera devotees during a daytime drama drought, and the author's fans will likely lap up every word. At 17, Casey Edwards has experienced plenty of heartache and betrayal. Her mother, Evie, neglects her; her stepbrother, Ronnie, sexually abuses her; and her fianc may leave her if she doesn't have sex with him. The day Casey finally fights back and stabs Ronnie in the leg, she miscarries his baby and comes to 10 years later in a mental hospital with no memory of her life before being admitted. Evie, now wealthy and married, greets Casey with little enthusiasm, as do the citizens of Sweetwater, Ga., and she can't help but wonder why. Slowly, she pieces together the lost details of her life with the help of Dr. Blake Hunter, a gorgeous family friend, but there are those who will do anything to keep her memories buried. Michaels's characterizations are far from subtle, and her plot consists of too many highs and lows with very little in between. However, her incisive descriptions of Southern life (and the mannerisms that separate the wealthy from the working masses) will impress, even if the conventional romance between Blake and Casey doesn't.

    "synopsis": "They watched Danilo Silva for days before they finally grabbed him. He was living alone, a quiet life on a shady street in Brazil; a simple life in a modest home, certainly not one of luxury. Certainly no evidence of the fortune they thought he had stolen. He was much thinner and his face had been altered. He spoke a different language, and spoke it very well.But Danilo had a past with many chapters. Four years earlier he had been Patrick Lanigan, a young partner in a prominent Biloxi law firm. He had a pretty wife, a new daughter, and a bright future. Then one cold winter night Patrick was trapped in a burning car and died a horrible death. When he was buried his casket held nothing more than his ashes.From a short distance away, Patrick watched his own burial. Then he fled. Six weeks later, a fortune was stolen from his ex-law firm's offshore account. And Patrick fled some more.But they found him.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>Money is essentially the principal character in Grisham's new thriller. It is a very large sum of it. $90 million to be exact, that has motivated Gulf Coast lawyer Patrick Lanigan to concoct a scheme to disappear that is even more elaborate (if less convincing) than the one in the recent <i>The Big Picture</i>. It is money that drove a crooked defense contractor to try to pry loose a huge sum from Washington, and got Patrick's greedy law firm involved in the first place. And it is varying sums of money that enable Patrick to bribe his way out of a collection of indictments against him a yard long including one for first-degree murder when he is eventually found in his Brazilian hideaway and brought back to the U.S. to face the music. Already, at the end of <i>The Runaway Jury</i>, Grisham was displaying his fascination with the techniques of moving huge sums rapidly around the world, and here it becomes a key plot device. Even when tortured by his captors, Patrick can say he doesn't know where the money is, because only his Brazilian lover, fellow lawyer Eva Miranda, really knows and no one knows where she is. To call the plot of <i>The Partner</i> mechanical is at least partly a compliment: it is well-oiled, intricate and works smoothly. But its cynicism is remorseless: Lanigan is hardly a hero to warm to, despite his ingenuity (he puts on a lot of weight before his disappearance, just so he can take it off later and look altogether different). He is all calculation, and when it seems, at the end, as if someone has double-crossed him too, it is difficult to muster any sympathy. In Grisham's world money rules, and it is a sign of weakness to ignore its power. Not that the author is likely to do so, anyway; every indication is that his latest will rake it in once again.",

Lore Van Oesterling had been the daughter of one of the world's most powerful families...and now she was nobody, and she had to hide.\nThen out of the rain walked Spanner, predator and thief, who took her in, cared for her wound, and taught her how to reinvent herself again and again. No one could find Lore now: not the police, not her family, and not the kidnappers who had left her in that alley to die. She had escaped...but the cost of her newfound freedom was crime and deception, and she paid it over and over again, until she had become someone she loathed.\nLore had a choice: She could stay in the shadows, stay with Spanner...and risk losing herself forever. Or she could leave Spanner and find herself again by becoming someone else: stealing the identity implant of a dead woman, taking over her life, and creating a new future.\nBut to start again, Lore required Spanner's talents—Spanner, who needed her and hated her, and who always had a price. And even as Lore agreed to play Spanner's game one final time, she found that there was still the price of being a Van Oesterling to be paid. Only by confronting her family, her past, and her own demons could Lore meld together who she had once been, who she had become, and the person she intended to be...\n\n\n                        From the author of the award-winning Ammonite comes the dark and intensely involving story of a young woman's struggle for survival and independence on the gritty underside of a near-future Europe.\n",

But only Pitt's most relentless pursuit enables him to identify the wildfire passions raging through this tragedy of good and evil, to hunt down the guilty and protect the innocent.<h3>Barnes & Noble Guide to New Fiction</h3>Perry delivers another Dickensian novel enriched by the color of the matchless Victorian era in magnificent London. \"Boy, has London changed!\" Complaints about the Britishisms kept this one from a higher score.",

    "synopsis": "America Throne is living the good life in L.A. Her career is sprouting, and she is in love. When the relationship falters, America falls. In nurturing a truce with her dead father, she hopes to make peace with all men.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>The protagonist of Gran's first novel is a young Manhattanite who works in publishing, dodges ex-boyfriends at parties, practices yoga and smokes the occasional cigarette. While this may suggest a certain urban singleton on the other side of the Atlantic, Gran, herself a New Yorker, offers instead a character who is not in search of the perfect man. Mary Forrest is finally coming of age. She lost her father when she was a young girl, and now that she's an adult, is making a conscientious effort to forge a better relationship with her mother, Evelyn, the aging founder of a prestigious literary magazine. For her 29th birthday, Mary's friend Chloe gives her a session with an astrologer, who tells her that when she reaches age 29, the planet Saturn returns to the same spot it was in when she was born, so it is now that she really becomes an adult. What this means for Mary is learning to love her job at Intelligentsia, an online bookseller, and to enjoy Evelyn's company. But she comes up against some resistance: at work, an obviously nutty colleague tries openly to steal Mary's job; on the family front, Evelyn is beginning to lose her memory and her mind. Gran has crafted an almost unbelievably strong character in Mary; her optimism and sturdy staying power are admirable. Although many of the book's New York publishing scenes may alienate readers who don't frequent the same circles, Gran has written a smart, discerning story that will appeal to readers seeking to break out of Bridget Jones tedium.

    "synopsis": "A New York Times Notable Book and the March 2001 selection of Oprah's Book Club&reg; ! <br><br>Icy Sparks is the sad, funny and transcendent tale of a young girl growing up in the mountains of Eastern Kentucky during the 1950&rsquo;s. Gwyn Hyman Rubio&rsquo;s beautifully written first novel revolves around Icy Sparks, an unforgettable heroine in the tradition of Scout in To Kill a Mockingbird or Will Treed in Cold Sassy Tree. At the age of ten, Icy, a bright, curious child orphaned as a baby but raised by adoring grandparents, begins to have strange experiences. Try as she might, her \"secrets\"&mdash;verbal croaks, groans, and physical spasms&mdash;keep afflicting her. As an adult, she will find out she has Tourette&rsquo;s Syndrome, a rare neurological disorder, but for years her behavior is the source of mystery, confusion, and deep humiliation.<br><br><br>Narrated by a grown up Icy, the book chronicles a difficult, but ultimately hilarious and heartwarming journey, from her first spasms to her self-acceptance as a young woman. Curious about life beyond the hills, talented, and energetic, Icy learns to cut through all barriers&mdash;physical, mental, and spiritual&mdash;in order to find community and acceptance.<br><br>Along her journey, Icy faces the jeers of her classmates as well as the malevolence of her often-ignorant teachers&mdash;including Mrs. Stilton, one of the most evil fourth grade teachers ever created by a writer. Called willful by her teachers and \"Frog Child\" by her schoolmates, she is exiled from the schoolroom and sent to a children&rsquo;s asylum where it is hoped that the roots of her mysterious behavior can be discovered. Here Icy learns about difference&mdash;her own and those who are even more scarred than she. Yet, it isn&rsquo;t until Icy returns home that she really begins to flower, especially through her friendship with the eccentric and obese Miss Emily, who knows first-hand how it feels to be an outcast in this tightly knit Appalachian community. Under Miss Emily&rsquo;s tutelage, Icy learns about life&rsquo;s struggles and rewards, survives her first comical and heartbreaking misadventure with romance, discovers the healing power of her voice when she sings, and ultimately&mdash;takes her first steps back into the world.<br><br>Gwyn Hyman Rubio&rsquo;s Icy Sparks is a fresh, original, and completely redeeming novel about learning to overcome others&rsquo; ignorance and celebrate the differences that make each of us unique.<br><h3>Tara Bayton</h3>This is the sweet, zealously optimistic story of a young girl who learns to accept and embrace what is most alarming about herself....An entertaining and absorbing story. -- <i>NY Times Book Review</i>",

Awe And Exhilaration--along With Heartbreak And Mordant Wit--abound In This Account Of The Aging Humbert Humbert's Obsessive, Devouring, And Doomed Passion For The Nymphet Dolores Haze. Lolita Is Also The Story Of A Hypercivilized European Colliding With The Cheerful Barbarism Of Postwar America, But Most Of All, It Is A Meditation On Love--love As Outrage And Hallucination, Madness And Transformation.

The novel was met with moral outrage by contemporary critics who, dazzled perhaps by Wilde's brilliant style, may have confused the author with his creation, Lord Henry, to whom even Dorian protests, 'You cut life to pieces with your epigrams.'. Encouraged by Lord Henry to substitute pleasure for goodness and art for reality, Dorian tries to watch impassively as he brings misery and death to those who love him. But the picture is watching him, and, made hideous by the marks of sin, it confronts Dorian with the reflection of his fall from grace, the silent bearer of what is in effect a devastating moral judgement.",

    "synopsis": "International best-selling author Alexander McCall Smith delivers another delightful tale from his critically acclaimed No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series. Precious Ramotswe's comfortable existence as the only detective in Botswana is suddenly rattled when the Satisfaction Guaranteed Detective Agency opens, and its brochure proclaims, Don't take any chances! Entrust your enquiries to a MAN! But with wisdom on her side, Mma Ramotswe figures to upstage her competition.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>The fourth appearance of Precious Ramotswe, protagonist of The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency and two sequels, is once again a charming account of the everyday challenges facing a female private detective in Botswana. In his usual unassuming style, McCall Smith takes up Ramotswe's story soon after the events described in Tears of the Giraffe. Precious and her fianc , Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, still have not set a wedding date, but they continue to nurture the sibling orphans in their care, as well as the entrepreneurial ambitions of Precious's assistant, Mma Makutsi, who sets out to open a typing school for men. Along the way, Ramotswe handles a few cases and negotiates the arrival of a rival detective in Gaborone. The competition, a sexist detective who boasts of New York City street smarts, proves a delicious foil to his distaff counterpart. A moral component enters the story in the person of a successful engineer who wishes to atone for his past sins. He enlists Ramotswe to help him find the woman he has wronged, and this case comes to a satisfying yet hardly sentimental conclusion. But the real appeal of this slender novel is Ramotswe's solid common sense, a proficient blend of folk wisdom, experience and simple intelligence. She is a bit of a throwback to the days of courtesy and manners, and casts disapproving glances at the apprentices in her fianc 's auto shop who obsess about girls instead of garage protocol. A dose of easy humor laces the pages, as McCall Smith throws in wry observations, effortlessly commenting on the vagaries his protagonist encounters as she negotiates Botswana bureaucracy. This is another graceful entry in a pleasingly modest and wise series. (Apr. 29) Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information.",

And in an amazing feat of imagination, here are the magnificent Thoroughbreds themselves, from the filly orphaned at birth to the brown horse who always wins by a nose, a lovable \"claimer\" who passes from owner to owner on a heartwrenching journey down from the winner's circle.\nAll the constant excitement of racing courses through a novel that opens up a fascinating world even as it moves us with its exploration of wanting, loving, and striving; of our mysterious bond with animals; and, above all, of our profound desire to connect-emotionally, sexually, spiritually-with each other.",

    "synopsis": "\"You have much to bear for an honest man...\" Alexander Mendeneres's family have had a set of scrolls ever since 1200AD, when a heavenly messenger chose a scribe to record the gods' predictions for mankind. Now Alexander's wife has stolen the priceless articles and taken them to the United States to find a buyer. Alexander must use his young daughter as bait in order to trap his conniving spouse.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>After more than 50 books, crowd-pleaser Michaels (Dear Emily, etc.) dishes up a romantic thriller that begins with the history of a Nostradamus-like manuscript. In A.D. 1200, a messenger from God entrusts God's predictions for the future of mankind to a humble scribe. Once the scribe has finished the scrolls, he in turn entrusts them to the venerable Mendeneres family. Flash forward to the present, when the reader is introduced to wealthy Alexander Mendeneres, whose scheming and vindictive wife, Valerie, has stolen the scrolls, bringing them from Argentina to Manhattan hoping to sell them for profit. Alex finds himself forced to use his precocious 10-year-old daughter, Maria, as a pawn in the battle with Valerie, but Maria takes matters into her own hands when she finds herself alone in New York, teaming up with lonely 20-something editor Dani Arnold. Kidnappings, danger and romance ensue. Despite the contemporary setting, the characters all seem to have walked out of early Hollywood films. The bad guys could be Cagney co-stars; Maria is a modern-day Shirley Temple, dispensing advice on politics, smoking and love; and Alex is melodramatic in a Fernando Lamas sort of way. As for Dani, she's the kind of bravely foolish heroine of yesteryear who insists on going off half-cocked and alone, yet she stops for a cigarette when she stumbles over a corpse in the enemy's lair. Everything about the novel, including the paint-by-numbers cover, is so anachronistically clich d, it's practically high camp. But Michaels's many fans and other readers who prefer their chaste romance to be sealed only with kisses may not mind. (Dec.) Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information.",

She includes practical descriptions of a number of ways Christians have prayed through the centuries, from using the Jesus Prayer or rosary to praying with the stories of scripture and prayer book liturgies. Guenther also discusses basic matters of Christian practice, such as making a confession, intercession, going on retreat, simplifying our lives, using a journal to pray, finding a spiritual director, and praying through times of desolation when God does not seem to be listening.",

    "synopsis": "Here is the second novel in the blockbuster new trilogy that reveals the never-before-told story of the young Han Solo.&#160;&#160;Set before the Star Wars(r) movie adventures, these books chronicle the coming-of-age of the galaxy's most famous con man, smuggler and thief.Solo is now a fugitive from the Imperial Navy.&#160;&#160;But he has made a valuable friend in a former Wookiee slave named Chewbacca, who has sworn Han a&#160;&#160;life debt.&#160;&#160;Han will need all the help he can get.&#160;&#160;For the Ylesian Hutts have dispatched the dreaded bounty hunter Boba Fett to track down the man who already outsmarted them once.&#160;&#160;But Han and Chewie find themselves in even bigger trouble when they agree to lend their services to the crime lords Jiliac and Jabba the Hutt.&#160;&#160;Suddenly the two smugglers are thrust into the middle of a battle between the might of the Empire and the treachery of their outlaw allies...a battle where even victory means death!<h3>VOYA</h3>Veteran science fiction author Crispin has produced a trilogy about the slightly shady smuggler and con man Han Solo that is perfect for the legions of fans of the movies and their spin-offs. The books should be read in order as a unit. In the first novel, Han Solo is \"rescued\" from the slums of Corellia to serve in Garris Shrike's roving band of space criminals. Han escapes Shrike's brutal rule only to take a pilot's job serving the grotesque t'landa Til and their overlords, the Hutts, on the slave planet Ylesia. How Han and his new friends, Bria and Muuurgh, outsmart the Hutts and escape from Ylesia with a fortune makes for an exciting and fast-paced story. The second volume of the trilogy opens with Han's life in a shambles. Not only has he been kicked out of the Imperial Navy for saving the life of a slave, the ex-slave-a huge, hairy Wookiee-has attached himself to Han to whom he now owes a \"life debt.\" When the still resentful Hutts set bounty hunter Boba Fett on his trail, however, Han will be grateful for the friendship of the gigantic alien. In the concluding book of the trilogy, Han has just won Lando Calrissian's speedy Millennium Falcon in a game of sabacc. He and Chewie are now the best of all the smugglers, even though the Empire and the mysterious Darth Vader are growing threats. A sure opportunity at enormous wealth and the reappearance of an ex-girlfriend and her group of Rebel insurgents result in Han and Chewie penniless and wanted throughout the galaxy. The novel concludes as Han and Chewie, broke and with prices on their heads, contract a charter night for an \"old guy in the Jawa robe, and the kid in a moisture farmer's outfit.\" Readers who love good space opera and Star Wars will devour this trilogy the way the Hutts devour nala-tree frogs.

    "synopsis": "<P><center>IT WAS THE PERFECT CRIME</center> <P> Unfortunately, it also led to the perfect punishment. When Jack Rankin gets busted for defacing a school desk with a huge wad of disgusting, watermelon bubble gum, the principal sentences him to three weeks of after-school gum cleanup for the chief custodian. The problem is, Jack's anger at the chief custodian was the reason for his gum project in the first place. The chief custodian happens to be Jack's dad. <P> But doing time in the school basement after hours reveals some pretty surprising things&#58; about the school, about Jack's father, and about Jack himself.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>As he did in Frindle and The Landry News, Clements here puts an intelligent and credible fifth-grader at the center of a memorable novel. As the book opens, Jack, after much careful planning, is executing the perfect crime: he assembles the biggest, stickiest wad of gum imaginable and affixes it to the desk in the back row of the music room. Why? The novel then flashes back to the moment when Jack's father, John, the head janitor, comes into his classroom to clean up vomit and calls Jack son. At that point, Jack felt like a giant letter had been branded on his forehead--L, for Loser. When Jack gets caught and the vice principal assigns him to three weeks' duty of scraping gum from school property after school, Jack decides, There was only one person to blame for the whole mess.... Thanks again, Dad. Clements slowly builds an even, affecting narrative to reveal how Jack comes to better know and appreciate John, effectively drawing a parallel between this father-son relationship and John's relationship with his own father. The author adds a mystery to the mix when the boy discovers keys in the janitor's closet, which unlock literal doors to his understanding of his father. The author's uncanny ability to capture the fragile transformation from child to adolescent and its impact on family relationships informs every aspect of the novel. Ages 8-12.

Hennie's stagnant existence ends when she begins dating Dan Roth, an impoverished science teacher and social reformer who despises the materialistic excesses of the rich. She weds Dan despite her middle-class family's objections and her knowledge of his earlier womanizing. The marriage is tested when Dan's activism alienates Hennie's wealthy brother-in-law, Walter Werner, whose father owns tenements, and when Hennie agrees to raise Leah, daughter of a dying factory worker. The girl matures into a shrewd, forceful woman who gravitates toward the Roths' exceptionally mild-mannered son, Freddy.

Soon, one unlikely hero is led into a chilling confrontation with The Straw Men. No one knows who they are--or why they kill. But they must be stopped<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>Marshalls debut thriller, which is essentially two seemingly independent stories that meet in the middle, takes its time hooking readers. But once the complex and disparate plot lines meld, this expansive work demands the readers attention. In Dyersburg, Mont., narrator Ward Hopkins, attempting to make sense of the accident that killed his parents, discovers a note and videotape that lead him to believe their lives (and deaths) were not as they appeared. Meanwhile, the abduction of 14-year-old Sarah Becker renews the search for a serial killer who scalps his victims, embroiders their names into sweaters using their hair and then delivers the clothing to the victims parents. As Ward and his CIA buddy slowly unravel the mystery surrounding Wards parents, FBI agent Nina Baynam and former LAPD homicide detective John Zandt search for the elusive killer. Their paths cross when a series of connections is made between the victims and a bizarre cult known as The Straw Men. Marshalls book is filled with pages of uninterrupted description, which, while compelling, doesnt make for fast reading. But, to borrow a clichE, the devil is in the details. Thats certainly the case with this novel, whose graphic scenes of child abuse and dismemberment depict humankind at its most evil. (Aug.) Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information.",

AE, the pseudonym under which George Russell wrote, said in the <I>Living Age</I> that the work is the most purely beautiful thing Lord Dunsany has written.

For each of them, college promises a bright future and a way to disconnect from a dark, haunted past. But as winter sets in, their secret histories threaten to disrupt the layers of deceit that protect their fragile new lives. <P>One dark night a professor's wife is found drowned in an icy river, and rumors of murder threaten the safe haven of Atherton. Within days, Randall's illicit affair with the professor is about to be revealed in the local press. Then, an old mystery emerges from the shadows - the discovery of a co-ed's corpse in a frozen creek twenty years before makes these accidents of the past and the present look a little too closely connected. Gradually, the three friends find themselves snared in a web of lies, a web spun long before their days at Atherton. Snowbound on the university campus, they are unwitting captives of a malevolent force that drives them inexorably toward the \"snow garden\" of the title - a place of nightmares that is all too real, and all too near.<h3>Advocate</h3><I>The Snow Garden</I> offers finely nuanced character studies as its pages whiz by to its chilling conclusion.",

Por medio de su don narrativo, Eva Luna inventa una realidad personal determinada por la magia y el destino.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>A woman makes love to an Indian dying of snakebite, miraculously restoring him to life and engendering a daughter named Eva``so she will love life.'' Thus begins Allende's latest novel, a magnificent successor to The House of the Spirits and Of Love & Shadows. Set in a Latin American country, it relates Eva's picaresque adventures. Brought up in the house of an eccentric doctor devoted to mummifying corpses, where her mother is a servant, Eva is left an orphan at six. Her black godmother, or madrina , leases her as a servant to a series of bizarre households of metaphorical significance, the last of which she leaves in grand style upon emptying a government Minister's chamberpot over his head. Interleaved with Eva's story is her account of a certain Rolf Carle, with whom her life will become linkedshe tells of his youth in Nazi Austria and young manhood as a filmmaker in South America. Through a series of improbable and felicitous coincidences, Eva is taken under the wing of such exotic benefactors as a street urchin who becomes a guerrilla leader, a colorful whorehouse Madam, a kindly Turkish merchant and a stunningly beautiful transsexual. Like the author, Eva is a prodigious fabulist, weaving extraordinary tales that change reality at will, making it, as she says, easier to bear. Although the fabulist's art is seen as dangerously escapist, Allende's wonderful novel, crammed with the strange and fantastical, the sensuous and the erotic, also speaks powerfully in the cause of freedom. 40,000 first printing; BOMC and QPBC alternate.

A lonely child, he found solace in Old Joe's simple wisdom and folk charms. The magic was lost, however, when Joe disappeared without warning one fall.\nYears later, Jay's life is stalled with regret and ennui. His bestselling novel, <b>Jackapple Joe,</b> was published ten years earlier and he has written nothing since. Impulsively, he decides to leave his urban life in London and, sight unseen, purchases a farmhouse in the remote French village of Lansquenet. There, in that strange and yet strangely familiar place, Jay hopes to re-create the magic of those golden childhood summers. And while the spirit of Joe is calling to him, it is actually a similarly haunted, reclusive woman who will ultimately help Jay find himself again.",

    "synopsis": "Full of promise is how anyone would have described Elizabeth Wurtzel at age ten, a bright-eyed little girl who painted, wrote stories, and excelled in every way. By twelve she was cutting her legs in the girls' bathroom and listening to scratchy recordings of the Velvet Underground. College was marked by a series of breakdowns, suicide attempts, and hospitalizations before she was finally given Prozac in combination with other psychoactive drugs, all of which have worked sporadically as Elizabeth's mood swings rise and fall like the lines of a sad ballad. This memoir, both harrowing and hilarious, gives voice to the high incidence of depression - especially among America's youth. Prozac Nation is a collective cry for help, a generational status report on today's young people, who have come of age fully entrenched in the culture of divorce, economic instability, and AIDS. \"This private world of loony bins and weird people which I always felt I occupied and hid in,\" writes Elizabeth, \"had suddenly turned inside out so that it seemed like this was one big Prozac Nation, one big mess of malaise. Perhaps the next time half a million people gather for a protest march on the White House green it will not be for abortion rights or gay liberation, but because we're all so bummed out.\" Writing with a vengeance (Nirvana, Joni Mitchell, and Dorothy Parker all rolled into one), Elizabeth Wurtzel will not go gentle into that good night. She wants off medication, she wants a family, and most definitely, a life worth living. <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> Twenty-six-year-old Wurtzel, a former critic of popular music for New York and the New Yorker, recounts in this luridly intimate memoir the 10 years of chronic, debilitating depression that preceded her treatment with Prozac in 1990. After her parents' acrimonious divorce, Wurtzel was raised by her mother on Manhattan's Upper West Side. The onset of puberty, she recalls, also marked the onset of recurrent bouts of acute depression, sending her spiraling into episodes of catatonic despair, masochism and hysterical crying. Here she unsparingly details her therapists, hospitalizations, binges of sex and drug use and the paralyzing spells of depression which afflicted her in high school and as a Harvard undergraduate and culminated in a suicide attempt and ultimate diagnosis of atypical depression, a severe, episodic psychological disorder. The title is misleading, for Wurtzel skimps on sociological analysis and remains too self-involved to justify her contention that depression is endemic to her generation. By turns emotionally powerful and tiresomely solipsistic, her book straddles the line between an absorbing self-portrait and a coy bid for public attention.

The ``strangers'' are thousands of miles apart when they begin to suffer inexplicable terrors. In California, Dom Corvaisis sleepwalks, fleeing from an unseen menace. In Massachusetts, gifted young Dr. Ginger Weiss's panic attacks threaten her career. A priest in the Midwest loses his faith suddenly, then finds he can heal fatally injured people. And, in Elko, Nevada, the owner of a motela tough ex-Marinebecomes paralyzed by fears of the dark. Mysterious clues bring these characters and others, similarly afflicted, to the motel, where apparently they had met long before. As they compare experiences, the victims realize they've been brainwashed and determine to find out why. That means facing death at the hands of a maniac in a scene that finally induces frissons of terror in the reader. But it's too late; Koontz has vitiated suspense throughout the narrative with numbing repetitions and long explanations of such matters as Jewish cooking, the baldachin over the altar at St. Patrick's Cathedral, a weaver's tools, etc.",

The money was good and getting better; a partnership was three years away. He was a rising star with no time to waste, no time to stop, no time to toss a few coins into the cups of panhandlers. No time for a conscience. But a violent encounter with a homeless man stopped him cold. Michael survived; his assailant did not. Who was this man? Michael did some digging, and learned that he was a mentally ill veteran who'd been in and out of shelters for many years. Then Michael dug a little deeper, and found a dirty secret, and the secret involved Drake & Sweeney.<h3>People Magazine</h3>Enough plot zigzags to keep readers happily hooked.",

    "synopsis": "<P><b>The phone messages waiting for Henry Pierce clearly aren't for him&#58; Where is Lilly? This is her number. It's on the site. Pierce has just moved into a new apartment, and he's been chasing the dime&#151;doing all it takes so his company comes out first with a scientific breakthrough worth millions. But he can't get the messages for Lilly out of his head. As Pierce tries to help a woman he has never met, he steps into a world of escorts, websites, sex, and secret passions. A world where his success and expertise mean nothing...and where he becomes the chief suspect in a murder case, trapped in the fight of his life.</b><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>Former journalist and Edgar Award winner Connelly (City of Bones) skillfully unfolds a story of obsessive curiosity and taut psychological suspense ideally suited to audio translation. A burgeoning technologies company, broken engagement and new apartment leave little time for 34-year-old workaholic chemist Henry Pierce to even check his messages. But when he does, he realizes his new telephone number was formerly that of a beautiful prostitute named Lilly, who's still receiving dozens of messages, but hasn't been heard from in over a month. Veteran audiobook narrator and actor Davis provides crisp, stage-honed vocals, with his versatile characterizations easily shifting from the Valley talk of an aging surfer/computer hacker to the hesitant pleas of Lilly's johns. Haunted by his own sister's murder, Henry eschews his normal all-business demeanor and plunges head first into the seedy sex underworld, where he befriends a hardened escort, makes a grisly discovery that may prove Lilly's demise, as well as his own, and is fingered as the prime suspect by the cops. Davis's masterful dramatizations deliver the perfect complement to Connelly's sophisticated mystery, sure to attract fans of his Harry Bosch series, as well as new listeners. Simultaneous release with the Little, Brown hardcover (Forecasts, Sept. 16). (Oct.) Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information.",

    "synopsis": "<P>Heavy Snow...Icy Desires...Cold-Blooded Murder<P>Clare Fergusson, St. Alban's new priest, fits like a square peg in the conservative Episcopal parish at Miller's Kill, New York. She is not just a \"lady,\" she's a tough ex Army chopper pilot, and nobody's fool. Then a newborn infant left at the church door brings her together with the town's police chief, Russ Van Alstyne, who's also ex-Army and a cynical good shepherd for the stray sheep of his hometown. Their search for the baby's mother quickly leads them into the secrets that shadow Miller's Kill like the ever-present Adirondacks. What they discover is a world of trouble, an attraction to each other-and murder... <P>\"Superb!\"-<i>Library Journal</i><P>\"Terrific action scenes...what really distinguishes<i> In the Bleak Midwinter</i>, however, is the author's skillful portrayal of her protagonist's inner conflict.\"<i>-Washington Post Book World</i><P>\"A riveting page-turner from start to finish.\"-<i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review)<h3>Library Journal</h3>This is the first of three engaging mysteries featuring Episcopal priest Clare Ferguson, newly appointed rector of St. Alban's Church in the upstate New York village of Millers Kill. Shortly before Christmas, an infant is left on the steps of St. Alban's with a note indicating that the baby should be given to a specific couple in the congregation. Clare sees the abandonment as a way to begin a mission project to help unwed mothers, but her enthusiasm is rebuffed by the senior warden of the socially conservative church vestry, a retired army colonel. Suspicion mounts when the child's mother, an 18-year-old college student from the wrong side of the tracks, is found dead. Clare joins Millers Kill police chief Russ Van Alstyne in the search for the murderer. There are as many slippery twists and turns as there are on the snowy Adirondack mountain roads that Clare must negotiate. Narrator Suzanne Toren handles all the voices deftly, giving just a touch of Southern accent to the Virginia-born Clare; her pacing captures the mounting tension perfectly. An excellent selection.

    "synopsis": "When small items disappear throughout the town, the residents are up in arms! Pickax has seldom fallen victim to \"big city\" crimes, particularly during the holiday season. But after the bridge club's money is stolen, the townspeople decide that there is more to this mystery. The rash of petty thievery started when banker Willard Carmichael and his much younger (and flashier) wife, Danielle, moved to Pickax from Down Below. Along with their big-city lifestyle, Willard brought plans to restore the Victorian houses on Gingerbread Alley (fondly known as Pleasant Street). Unfortunately, Willard is murdered in an apparent mugging Down Below. When a local man is accused of the thievery, newspaper columnist Jim Qwilleran has serious questions about the recent crimes plaguing Pickax. For one thing, Danielle's cousin Carter Lee seems too eager to pick up where Willard left off in the restoration project. When he begins to romance wealthy widow Lynette Duncan, things really go awry. It's up to Qwill, Koko and Yum Yum to set the town right and bring the guilty party to justice before both the Duncan family fortune and Pickax are destroyed by greed.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>Nothing is sacred in this latest installment of the trials and tribulations of life in Moose County, \"400 miles north of everywhere,\" as locals face a green Christmas, an outbreak of petty larceny and a tacky new resident. As the holidays approach, someone has taken to stealing small articles of apparently little value-gloves, sunglasses, a bag of old clothes, an antique doll. But these seem minor distractions from larger matters, like the new banker, Willard Carmichael, and his wife, Danielle, a flashy young woman with big hair who teeters on spiked heels as she flirts with an uncooperative newspaper columnist, Qwilleran, seen last in The Cat Who Said Cheese (1996). Willard fits right in, devoting himself to restoring Pleasant Street's Victorian homes with the help of Danielle's cousin, Carter Lee James, a preservation consultant. Just after Christmas, Willard is killed in a mugging in Detroit; then a local boy is arrested for the petty thefts and an old friend becomes engaged to James, all events that raise Qwill's suspicions and inspire strange behavior in his sleuthing cats, Koko and Yum Yum. Cranky and sometimes acerbic, Qwill fights off the sentimentality of the season while investigating the world of historically correct renovations. By springtime, with the help of Koko in particular, he brings a murderer and thief to justice in an accomplished mystery that is as smooth as the season's first snowfall.

His 60-year-long Journalistic Career Has Spanned The Great Depression, Several Wars, And The Extraordinary Changes That Have Engulfed Our Nation Over The Last Two-thirds Of The 20th Century. When Walter Cronkite Advised His Television Audience In 1968 That The War In Vietnam Could Not Be Won, President Lyndon B. Johnson Said: If I've Lost Cronkite, I've Lost Middle America. Now, At The Age Of Eighty, Cronkite Has Written His Life Story-the Personal And Professional Odyssey Of The Original Anchorman For Whom That Very Word Was Coined. As A Witness To The Crucial Events Of This Century-first For The Houston Press, Then For The United Press Wire Service, And Finally For Cbs In The Fledgling Medium Of Television-cronkite Set A Standard For Integrity, Objectivity, Enthusiasm, Compassion, And Insight That Is Difficult To Surpass.^ He Is An Overflowing Vessel Of History, And A Direct Link With The People And Places That Have Defined Our Nation And Established Its Unique Role In The World. But Walter Cronkite Is Also The Man Who Loved To Drive Race Cars For The Same Reason That Others Do Exhibitionist, Dangerous Stunts. It Sets Us Apart From The Average Man; Puts Us, In Our Own Minds, On A Level Just A Little Above The Chap Who Doesn't Race. He Is Also The Man Whose Softheartedness Knows No Rational Bounds And Who Always Had Great Problems At The Theater, Tearing Up At The Slightest Offense Against Animals And People, Notably The Very Old Or The Very Young. He Is The Man Who Could Barely Refrain From Spitting On The Defendants At The Nuremberg Trials, And Who Could Barely Announce President Kennedy's Assassination Over The Air For The Sobs In His Throat.^ Walter Cronkite Helped Launch The Juggernaut Of Television, And Tried To Imbue It With His Own Respect For Quality And Ethics; But Now He Occupies A Ringside Seat During The Decline Of His Profession And The Ascent Of The Lowest Common Denominator. As He Aptly Observes, They'd Rewrite Exodus To Include A Car Chase. Still, The American People Know The Difference. They Know That For Decades They Have Had The Privilege Of Getting Their News From A Gentleman Of The Highest Caliber. And They Will Immensely Enjoy A Reporter's Life. Walter Cronkite.",

But then the beautiful and sensual Marchioness Michelene Fonsard spirits them from the hospital to her lavish French chateau, opening the door to Reuben's dreams of wealth and power. Reuben and Mickey fall in love and life is idyllic for the three friends&#151;until the arrival of the lovely and spoiled Bebe Rosen unleashes savage passions and desperate deceptions that explode.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>In this modern-day melodrama of paradise lost, Reuben Tarz and Daniel Bishop are rescued from a French hospital at the close of WW I to share a luxurious chateau with Mickey, a sexy French marchioness. Their tranquil retreat is shaken up by the arrival of 16-year-old Bebe Rosen, daughter of an American movie mogul. Michaels creates a test of love for Reuben, Mickey and Bebe that each inevitably fails. The rest of the novel charts their punishment. Aside from Daniel and Reuben's friendship born of the adversities of war, and Mickey's maternal devotion to the illegitimate son born of Reuben's rape of Bebe, no love endures, and any apparent understanding between the sexes is an illusion destined to be violently shattered. Michaels's novels (the Texas trilogy) always evince a strong sense of morality, but here this has turned sour and vindictive. The Hollywood setting in which Bebe and Reuben work out their fates is a hollow, unconvincing cliche--as though Michaels can barely stand to ponder the ugly, despair-sodden world she depicts.

    "synopsis": "With only a yellowing photograph in hand, a young man - also named Jonathan Safran Foer - sets out to find the woman who might or might not have saved his grandfather from the Nazis. Accompanied by an old man haunted by memories of the war, an amorous dog named Sammy Davis, Junior, Junior, and the unforgettable Alex, a young Ukrainian translator who speaks in a sublimely butchered English, Jonathan is led on a quixotic journey over a devastated landscape and into an unexpected past. As their adventure unfolds, Jonathan imagines the history of his grandfather's village, conjuring a magical fable of startling symmetries that unite generations across time. Lit by passion, fear, guilt, memory, and hope, the characters in Everything Is Illuminated mine the black holes of history. As the search moves back in time, the fantastical history moves forward, until reality collides with fiction in a heart-stopping scene of extraordinary power. An arresting blend of high comedy and great tragedy, this is a story about searching for people and places that no longer exist, for the hidden truths that haunt every family, and for the delicate but necessary tales that link past and future. Exuberant and wise, hysterically funny and deeply moving, EVERYTHING IS ILLUMINATED is an astonishing debut.<br>\n\n\n                        Winner of the National Jewish Book Award for fiction.\n",

    "synopsis": "“Riveting . . . While I Was Gone [celebrates] what is impulsive in human nature.”<br>\n–The New York Times\n“Miller weaves her themes of secrecy, betrayal, and forgiveness into a narrative that shines.”<br>\n–Time\nJo Becker has every reason to be content. She has three dynamic daughters, a loving marriage, and a rewarding career. But she feels a sense of unease. Then an old housemate reappears, sending Jo back to a distant past when she lived in a communal house in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Drawn deeper into her memories of that fateful summer in 1968, Jo begins to obsess about the person she once was. As she is pulled farther from her present life, her husband, and her world, Jo struggles against becoming enveloped by her past and its dark secret.\n“[While I Was Gone] swoops gracefully between the past and the present, between a woman’s complex feelings about her husband and her equally complex fantasies–and fears–about another man. . . . [Miller writes] well about the trials of faith.”<br>\n–The New York Times Book Review\n“Quietly gripping . . . Jo shines steadily as the flawed and thoroughly modern heroine. As in her 1986 novel, The Good Mother, Miller shows how impulses can fracture the family.”<br>\n–USA Today\n“Marvelous . . . poignant . . . powerful.”<br>\n–Seattle Times/Post Intelligencer",

    "synopsis": "Working for Vogue, Amy spends her days dressing waif models in London's latest apparel while fending off insults from the Gucci-garbed staff. Hardly the glamorous job she hoped it would be. But that won't stop her from fantasizing about the jet-set life she knows she's destined for--or the prince who's bound to redeem her from a less than glowing record in romance.<br><br>However, beneath her dreamy exterior, Amy has a sure streak of common sense. So when the impossible happens--and her path crosses that of London's hottest film star--she swoons with longing, expecting nothing in return. But Orlando Rock has other ideas. For Amy is just the kind of girl he's after--smart and witty, with a penchant for quoting from the classics, different from the daft supermodels and vain leading ladies he's dated before. Or is she? For with fame, fortune, and true love just around the corner, Amy's head is spinning, her jet-fueled imagination poised for takeoff. Is her love for Orlando stronger than her lust for the limelight--or is she merely fated to be the paparazzi's latest prey . . .?<br><br>Hip and hilarious, this enchanting, sizzlingly sexy tale of a winsome twenty-something caught between romance and reality will have you rooting her on through each outrageous mishap and daring plunge toward love. . . .<br><br><br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i><h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>The British Invasion rolls on, with permutations of Bridget Jones popping up everywhere, this time in Naylor's light-hearted and assured debut novel. Twentysomething Amy is a fashion assistant at Vogue, where she dresses undernourished teen models who \"look like heroin addicts in bondage gear.\" Despite the Cinderella nature of her surprisingly unglamorous job, Amy remains staunchly convinced that fame and fortune are in her future. When she meets her Prince Charming in the form of gorgeous film star Orlando Rock, she believes that her dreams of romance and celebrity have finally come true. But then the hitch: although he returns Amy's affections, Orlando is determined to keep their romance a secret from the tabloids, escorting her only to out-of-the-way places not at all consonant with her ideas of the high life. Will Amy be able to forgive the screen god for merely loving her and wanting to be with her? Naylor hilariously details Amy's frenzied preparation for dates with Orlando while providing her with a lively supporting cast, most notably in the person of Amy's boss, who could easily do a stint on Absolutely Fabulous. She's also savvy enough to pepper the plot with the kinds of misunderstandings, complications and flies in the ointment that romantic comedies thrive on. Most importantly, however, she has created a comic heroine with a difference. A fan of Shakespeare, Dostoyevski and Ana s Nin, Amy's romantic expectations are glossed with literary allusions. With the sharply intelligent wit of a modern Elizabeth Bennett and the imagination of Ally McBeal, Amy is the best excuse yet for surrender (temporarily at least) to the Invasion.

    "synopsis": "<P>First American Publication<P>This stunning and elegiac novel by the author of the internationally acclaimed <b>Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</b> has sold over 4 million copies in Japan and is now available to American audiences for the first time.&#160;&#160;It is sure to be a literary event.<P>Toru, a quiet and preternaturally serious young college student in Tokyo, is devoted to Naoko, a beautiful and introspective young woman, but their mutual passion is marked by the tragic death of their best friend years before.&#160;&#160;Toru begins to adapt to campus life and the loneliness and isolation he faces there, but Naoko finds the pressures and responsibilities of life unbearable.&#160;&#160;As she retreats further into her own world, Toru finds himself reaching out to others and drawn to a fiercely independent and sexually liberated young woman.<P>A poignant story of one college student's romantic coming-of-age, <b>Norwegian Wood</b> takes us to that distant place of a young man's first, hopeless, and heroic love.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>In a complete stylistic departure from his mysterious and surreal novels (The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle; A Wild Sheep Chase) that show the influences of Salinger, Fitzgerald and Tom Robbins, Murakami tells a bittersweet coming-of-age story, reminiscent of J.R. Salamanca's classic 1964 novel, Lilith--the tale of a young man's involvement with a schizophrenic girl. A successful, 37-year-old businessman, Toru Watanabe, hears a version of the Beatles' Norwegian Wood, and the music transports him back 18 years to his college days. His best friend, Kizuki, inexplicably commits suicide, after which Toru becomes first enamored, then involved with Kizuki's girlfriend, Naoko. But Naoko is a very troubled young woman; her brilliant older sister has also committed suicide, and though sweet and desperate for happiness, she often becomes untethered. She eventually enters a convalescent home for disturbed people, and when Toru visits her, he meets her roommate, an older musician named Reiko, who's had a long history of mental instability. The three become fast friends. Toru makes a commitment to Naoko, but back at college he encounters Midori, a vibrant, outgoing young woman. As he falls in love with her, Toru realizes he cannot continue his relationship with Naoko, whose sanity is fast deteriorating. Though the solution to his problem comes too easily, Murakami tells a subtle, charming, profound and very sexy story of young love bound for tragedy. Published in Japan in 1987, this novel proved a wild success there, selling four million copies. (Sept.) Copyright 2000 Cahners Business Information.|",

    "synopsis": "Outstanding translations by leading contemporary scholars - many commissioned especially for this volume - are presented here in the first single edition to include the entire surviving corpus of works attributed to Plato in antiquity. In his introductory essay, John Cooper gives an account of his presentation of these works, discusses questions surrounding the chronology of their composition, comments on the dialogue form in which Plato wrote, and offers guidance on approaching the reading and study of Plato's works. Also included are concise introductions by Cooper and Hutchinson to each translation, meticulous annotation, and a comprehensive index. <h3>Library Journal</h3> One might be tempted to ask whether another collection of Plato's works is really necessary, given that they have been translated many times. But several factors set this particular volume apart, making it a worthy addition to most libraries. The translations are all relatively recent and thus reflect contemporary language use and terminology. The collection includes works such as the Minos, Epinomis, Demodocus, Eryxias, and Axiochus, which, though generally considered not to have been written by Plato, are \"Socratic\" in form or style. The text itself is clearly printed and laid out, with useful notes, and Cooper's introduction and notes about the translations are helpful in setting the dialogs in context. Finally, given what the purchaser receives, the price is reasonable. Recommended for all libraries.Terry C. Skeats, Bishop's Univ. Lib., Lennoxville, Quebec",

Although they pale in comparison to the novel, these stories, which comprise Chopin's third and last short-fiction collection, serve to flesh out the Chopin oeuvre and deserve a place on women's studies syllabi. As in The Awakening , the author's social critiques here demythologize women, marriage, religion and family. A women escapes ``the incessant chatter'' of other females at a party and retires to the male domain of the smoking room, where she puffs on hashish and dreams of a love affair torn asunder. The perverse Mrs. Mallard revels in her newfound freedom when informed that her husband is a casualty of a train accident and dies of a heart attack when he shows up alive. Her fiance is wasted by illness and reeks death, and a repulsed Dorothea bolts; elsewhere, a monk is lured by the voice of a woman, a former intimate. And in a twist on the plot of The Awakening , a husband, plagued by suspicions of his late wife's infidelity, casts himself in the river. Toth wrote the biography Kate Chopin. (Jan.)",

Needing to pay elder care for his mother, Victor has devised an ingenious scam: he pretends to choke on pieces of food while dining in upscale restaurants. He then allows himself to be “saved” by fellow patrons who, feeling responsible for Victor’s life, go on to send checks to support him. When he’s not pulling this stunt, Victor cruises sexual addiction recovery workshops for action, visits his addled mom, and spends his days working at a colonial theme park. His creator, Chuck Palahniuk, is the visionary we need and the satirist we deserve.<br>\n<i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>\nAuthor Biography: Chuck Palahniuk’s four other novels are the bestselling <i>Fight Club</i><i>,</i> which was made into a film by director David Fincher, <i>Survivor, Invisible Monsters</i><i>,</i> and <i>Choke</i>.

From the first page to the last, this book is a manifesto for clear thought.&quot;<br><br> *Los Angeles Times<br><br><br><br>&quot;POWERFUL . . . A stirring defense of informed rationality. . . Rich in surprising information and beautiful writing.&quot;<br><br> *The Washington Post Book World<br><br><br><br>How can we make intelligent decisions about our increasingly technology-driven lives if we don't understand the difference between the myths of pseudoscience and the testable hypotheses of science? Pulitzer Prize-winning author and distinguished astronomer Carl Sagan argues that scientific thinking is critical not only to the pursuit of truth but to the very well-being of our democratic institutions.<br><br><br><br>Casting a wide net through history and culture, Sagan examines and authoritatively debunks such celebrated fallacies of the past as witchcraft, faith healing, demons, and UFOs. And yet, disturbingly, in today's so-called information age, pseudoscience is burgeoning with stories of alien abduction, channeling past lives, and communal hallucinations commanding growing attention and respect. As Sagan demonstrates with lucid eloquence, the siren song of unreason is not just a cultural wrong turn but a dangerous plunge into darkness that threatens our most basic freedoms.<br><br><br><br>&quot;COMPELLING.&quot;<br><br> *USA Today<br><br><br><br>&quot;A clear vision of what good science means and why it makes a difference. . . . A testimonial to the power of science and a warning of the dangers of unrestrained credulity.&quot;<br><br> *The Sciences<br><br><br><br>&quot;PASSIONATE.&quot;<br><br> *San Francisco Examiner-Chronicle <h3>Publishers Weekly</h3> Eminent Cornell astronomer and bestselling author Sagan debunks the paranormal and the unexplained in a study that will reassure hardcore skeptics but may leave others unsatisfied. To him, purported UFO encounters and alien abductions are products of gullibility, hallucination, misidentification, hoax and therapists' pressure; some alleged encounters, he suggests, may screen memories of sexual abuse. He labels as hoaxes the crop circles, complex pictograms that appear in southern England's wheat and barley fields, and he dismisses as a natural formation the Sphinx-like humanoid face incised on a mesa on Mars, first photographed by a Viking orbiter spacecraft in 1976 and considered by some scientists to be the engineered artifact of an alien civilization. In a passionate plea for scientific literacy, Sagan deftly debunks the myth of Atlantis, Filipino psychic surgeons and mediums such as J.Z. Knight, who claims to be in touch with a 35,000-year-old entity called Ramtha. He also brands as superstition ghosts, angels, fairies, demons, astrology, Bigfoot, the Loch Ness monster and religious apparitions. (Feb.)",

Lucy leads a quiet, solitary life working for a best-selling (but remarkably untalented) writer. When he dies at his villa in Tuscany, Lucy flies to Tuscany to settle his affairs. What begins as a grim chore soon threatens Stark's Emersonian self-reliance—and her very sense of what is real. The villa harbors secrets: a missing manuscript, neighbors whose Byzantine arrogance veils their dark past, a phantom whose nocturnal visits tear a gaping hole in Lucy's well-honed skepticism. And to complicate matters: Massimo, a married man whose tender attentions render Lucy breathless.\nSmart, sophisticated, achingly beautiful, <b>Italian Fever</b> is one of the most original and compelling novels of the year.",

Ian, the older son, is a womanizer and compulsive gambler; Clive, the younger son, is an odd man barely five feet tall with no life outside his work as an accountant; and Amanda, Oliver's niece, whom he raised after her parents died in a plane crash, has been twice divorced and has had a difficult life. Dan, Amanda's brother, is the only Grey who appears to have no problems—except with his six-year-old daughter Caroline, whose behavior reminds him more and more of his troubled sister Amanda.\nThe trouble had started with Oliver Grey's decision to divide his nationally known business, Grey's Food, among Ian, Clive, and Dan. Amanda, bitter about being left out of the business, arrives from California to straighten out her financial holdings in the company. On a visit to Ellen, Dan's wife, Amanda sees a silver carousel much like the one Oliver gave her when she was a child. Ellen says the carousel was a gift to Caroline from Oliver. Amanda breaks down and tells Ellen that Oliver had given her the carousel to keep her from telling the truth about the unspeakable things he had done to her. Ellen, horrified by this revelation, finally understands why her daughter has been acting so strangely and why a therapist had raised the possibility that Caroline may have been sexually abused. Ellen goes to Oliver Grey's home that evening to confront him. And when she leaves he is dead.\nBelva Plain breaks new ground in this stunning new novel. A family drama with a strong strain of mystery, <b>The Carousel</b> confirms her standing as one of today's most compelling and popular writers.\n\n\n                        The stunning New York Times bestseller is now in paperback! When Sally Grey found out her daughter had been sexually abused, she was devastated. Never would anyone guess that her father-in-law, Oliver Grey, had a dark side few people knew about. And when an heirloom silver carousel unearths his shocking secret, lives will change forever--especially Oliver's.\n",

    "synopsis": "<B>Bestselling author Lisa Gardner's storytelling powers sweep to an electrifying new level in her second riveting audiobook. </B>The rapist left an indelible mark on their lives - now three women must live with the consequences of his violent brutality. But when he's murdered on his way to trial, the police investigation takes a scorching new focus. All three women had a reason to hate him. All three wanted him dead. But which one of them murdered him? Explosively plotted and unnervingly suspenseful, THE SURVIVORS CLUB sizzles from beginning to end.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>One cannot read this excellent new novel by bestselling author Gardner (The Next Accident) without wondering what actors might play these characters, especially the detectives. (Russell Crowe in his Bud White mode should star as Roan Griffin, and Dennis Franz seems a natural for the rumpled and sarcastic Fitz.) A sensitive but tough Rhode Island state police detective just returned from a bereavement leave (his beloved wife has died of cancer), Griffin encounters a hell of a case: a serial rapist, Eddie Como, is professionally hit in the courthouse parking lot, but whoever set up the kill doesn't want any loose ends: a car bomb results in an extra-crispy assassin. The prime suspects for this crime are Eddie's surviving victims: Jillian Hayes, who was beaten when she nearly caught the man after he raped her young sister, Trisha, who died; Carol Rosen, neglected wife of a successful attorney with a secret, who was raped in her own home; and the first victim, young Meg Pesaturo, who has mob ties but remembers nothing about the attack. But this is only the beginning of the case, for the rapist seems to rise from the dead to strike again and an old nemesis of Griffin's may have everything to do with it. The three-dimensional characterizations are compelling, and the plot barrels along with surprising new twists that feel inevitable once they occur. Though the plot doesn't jell until our hero meets his match in city cop Fitz, the book then rocks and rolls right up to a nail-biter ending coming perhaps a tad too quickly. Roan Griffin is a triumph: hurt, tightly wound, but holding it together and regaining his compassion and ability to reach out. And the grace-note minor characters\"the wily nurse Toppi and Jillian's silent former singer mother, Libby\"are gems. Gardner should hit the charts again with this one.

We Need Grace <i>and </i>truth. And For People To See Jesus In Us, They Must See Both.&rdquo; <h3>publishers Weekly</h3> hate The Sin But Love The Sinner Is The Gist Of The Paradox Explored In This Slender Point-of-purchase Book By Minister Alcorn. The Author Of Deadline Draws On His Experiences Of Getting Proabortion Activists, Unbelieving Academics And His Resistant Father To See The Light To Argue That Christians Must Display Grace-a Spirit Of Humility, Love And Inclusion-while Also Insisting On The Truth Of Christian Doctrine. Truth Without Grace, He Asserts, Yields A Self-righteous Pharisaism, While Grace Without Truth Leads To Moral Indifference And A Dilution Of Christ's Message. Alcorn Writes In A Contemporary Idiom, Likening Grace And Truth To A Binary Star System Or The Twin Strands Of The Dna Double Helix. But His Is A Traditional Evangelical Outlook That Combines Biblical Literalism, Hell-fire And A Deep Acknowledgment Of Personal Sin. Alcorn Registers His Fundamentalist Views On Such Topics As Relativism On Campus, The Fallacy Of Darwinism And Oprah Winfrey's Have-it-your-way Designer Religion. But He Also Chides Christians For Their Holier-than-thou Attitudes (jesus, He Warrants, Would Preach Five Sermons Against Self-righteous Churches For Every One Against Taverns) And Compares Himself With Evil-doers (i Am Dahmer. I Am Mao) In Attesting To The Fallen State Of All Humanity And Their Dependence On God's Unmerited Grace For Salvation. Firm But Forbearing, Alcorn's Tract Is A Dose Of Old-time Religion In A Smooth Modern Formulation. (jan.) Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information.",

    "synopsis": "Angle of Repose tells the story of Lyman Ward, a retired professor of history and author of books about the Western frontier, who returns to his ancestral home of Grass Valley, California, in the Sierra Nevada. Wheelchair-bound with a crippling bone disease and dependent on others for his every need, Ward is nonetheless embarking on a search of monumental proportions - to rediscover his grandmother, now long dead, who made her own journey to Grass Valley nearly a hundred years earlier. Like other great quests in literature, Lyman Ward's investigation leads him deep into the dark shadows of his own life.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>It is at first disconcerting that the narrator sounds half the age of the author's narrator&#58; Lyman Ward is an elderly, severely crippled historian at odds with his wife and children over his ability to live alone and write. But Mark Bramhall's comparative youth is soon forgotten as he leads us into the saga of intertwined generations. His pacing, his characterizations, and his convincing emotional repertoire embed us in this 1971 Pulitzer Prize winner that is in no way dated. Stegner's heroine is Ward's grandmother, Susan Burling Ward, a 19th-century writer and artist living in the rough mining towns of the West with her idealistic engineer husband. Bramhall's Susan is sometimes too girlish, but this, too, is a small matter; overall, he offers us a fine reading of a superb book. A Penguin Classics paperback. (Mar.)",

A simple yet utterly silly book, it provides a perfect beginning reading experience, combining exuberant illustrations with easy-to-decode words that delight both eye and ear. It's a must-have for every child's library, and makes an ideal gift.\n\n\n                        This nonsensical romp through a gallery of imaginary creatures introduces beginning readers to a variety of rhyming letter combinations. Meet the Yink, who likes to wink and drink pink ink. Or the Yop, who hops from finger top to finger top. Then there is morose Ned who doesn't like his little bed. The short anecdotal poems have just the right combination of humor and the fantastic to enrapture readers.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "<P>This brilliant epic novel set in New York and Prague introduces us to two misfit young men who make it big by creating comic-book superheroes. Joe Kavalier, a young artist who has also been trained in the art of Houdiniesque escape, has just smuggled himself out of Nazi-invaded Prague and landed in New York City. His Brooklyn cousin Sammy Clay is looking for a partner to create heroes, stories, and art for the latest novelty to hit America the comic book. Inspired by their own fears and dreams, Kavalier and Clay create the <i>Escapists</i>, <i>The Monitor</i>, and <i>Luna Moth</i>, inspired by the beautiful Rosa Saks, who will become linked by powerful ties to both men.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>This epic novel about the glory years of the American comic book (1939-1954) fulfills all the promise of Chabon's two earlier novels (<i>The Mysteries of Pittsburgh</i>; <i>Wonder Boys</i>) and two collections of short stories (<i>A Model World</i>; <i>Werewolves in Their Youth</i>), and nearly equals them all together in number of pages. Chabon's prodigious gifts for language, humor and wonderment come to full maturity in this fictional history of the legendary partnership between Sammy Klayman and Josef Kavalier, cousins and creators of the prewar masked comic book hero, the Escapist. Sammy is a gifted inventor of characters and situations who dreams \"the usual Brooklyn dreams of flight and transformation and escape.\" His contribution to the superhero's alter ego, Tom Mayflower, is his own stick legs, a legacy of childhood polio. Joe Kavalier, a former Prague art student, arrives in Brooklyn by way of Siberia, Japan and San Francisco. This improbable route marks only the first in a lifetime of timely escapes. Denied exit from Nazi Czechoslovakia with the visa his family sold its fortune to buy him, Joe, a disciple of Houdini, enlists the aid of his former teacher, the celebrated stage illusionist Bernard Kornblum, in a more desperate escape: crouched inside the coffin transporting Prague's famous golem, Rabbi Loew's miraculous automaton, to the safety of exile in Lithuania. This melodramatic getaway--almost foiled when the Nazi officer inspecting the corpse decides the suit it's wearing is too fine to bury--is presented with the careful attention to detail of a true-life adventure. Chabon heightens realism through a series of inspired matches: the Escapist, who roams the globe \"coming to the aid of those who languish in tyranny's chains,\" with Joe's powerlessness to rescue his family from Prague; Kavalier & Clay's Empire City with New York City in the early 1940s; and the comic industry's \"avidity of unburdening America's youth of the oppressive national mantle of tedium, ten cents at a time,\" with this fledgling art form's ability to gratify \"the lust for power and the gaudy sartorial taste of a race of powerless people with no leave to dress themselves.\" Well researched and deeply felt, this rich, expansive and hugely satisfying novel will delight a wide range of readers.

He was sure he possessed no magic, and knew that if he didn't find some soon, he would be exiled. According to the Good Magician Humpfrey, the charts said that Bink was as powerful as the King or even the Evil Magician Trent. Unfortunately, no one could determine its form. Meanwhile, Bink was in despair. If he didn't find his magic soon, he would be forced to leave....",

In 1889, two young Scotsmen, Rob Barclay and Angus McCaskill (grandfather of the narrator of English Creek, arrive in Montana, where for 30 years they struggle to find personal happiness and wrest a living from this demanding land. After losing the woman he loves, Angus marries Rob's sister Adair; their difficult relationship creates conflict, and then a bitter breach, between the two men. But if the thorny individualism of Rob and Angus results in lives that are never easy, they are rich in incident and growth, beautifully described in Doig's strong, savory prose. America's frontier history comes vividly to life in this absorbing saga filled with memorable characters. 50,000 first printing; major ad/promo. (September)",

On October 3, 1993, about a hundred elite U.S. soldiers were dropped by helicopters into the teeming market in the heart of Mogadishu, Somalia. Their mission was to abduct two top lieutenants of a Somali warlord and return to base. It was supposed to take an hour. Instead they found themselves pinned down through a long and terrible night fighting against thousands of heavily armed Somalis. The following morning, eighteen Americans were dead and more than seventy badly injured.\n\n                        1999 National Book Award nominee for Nonfiction.\n",

Hemingway's frank portrayal of the love between Lieutenant Henry and Catherine Barkley, caught in the inexorable sweep of war, glows with an intensity unrivaled in modern literature, while his description of the German attack on Caporetto -- of lines of fired men marching in the rain, hungry, weary, and demoralized -- is one of the greatest moments in literary history. A story of love and pain, of loyalty and desertion, <i>A Farewell to Arms,</i> written when he was 30 years old, represents a new romanticism for Hemingway.",

As Quoyle confronts his private demons — and the unpredictable forces of nature and society — he begins to see the possibility of love without pain or misery.\n A vigorous, darkly comic, and at times magical portrait of the contemporary North American family, <i>The Shipping News</i> shows why Annie Proulx is recognized as one of the most gifted and original writers in America today.\n\n\n                        <b>Winner of the 1993 National Book Award and the 1994 Pulitzer Prize.</b>\n",

In this extraordinary tale -- which preceded <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i> and <i>Hannibal,</i> Harris introduced the unforgettable character Dr. Hannibal Lecter. And in it, Will Graham -- the FBI man who hunted Lecter down -- risks his sanity and his life to duel a killer called...\n<b>The Red Dragon</b><br>\nA quiet summer night...a neat suburban house...and another happy family is shattered -- the latest victims of a grisly series of hideous sacrificial killings that no one understands, and no one can stop. Nobody lives to tell of the unimaginable carnage. Only the blood-stained walls bear witness.\n All hope rests on the Special Agent Will Graham, who must peer inside the killer's tortured soul to understand his rage, to anticipate and prevent his next vicious crime. Desperate for help, Graham finds himself locked in a deadly alliance with the brilliant Dr. Hannibal Lecter -- the infamous mass murderer who Graham put in prison years ago. As the imprisoned Lecter tightens the reins of revenge, Graham's feverish pursuit of the Red Dragon draws him inside the warped mind of a psychopath,, into an unforgettable world of demonic ritual and violence, beyond the limits of human terror.",

You'll meet a boy who turns into a TV set, and a girl who eats a whale. The Unicorn and the Bloath live there, and so does Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout who will not take the garbage out. It is a place where you wash your shadow and plant diamond gardens, a place where shoes fly, sisters are auctioned off, and crocodiles go to the dentist.\nShel Silverstein's masterful collection of poems and drawings is at once outrageously funny and profound.\n\n\n                        Irreverent, hilarious and wildly popular, Silverstein’s collection of verse is hard to put down. His black pen drawings are an integral part of the poems, which range from funny and gross to introspective or tender. Silverstein is a master at tickling the funny bone, and his book is definitely not just for kids!\n",

    "synopsis": "Her father's involvement with the Kurdish resistance movement in Iraq forces thirteen-year-old Tara to flee with her family over the border into Iran, where they face an unknown future.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>Laird weaves compelling facts about the conflicts between the Arabs and the Kurds into her gripping tale about one family's escape to freedom. After witnessing a teen's brutal murder and meeting a wounded revolutionary, 12-year-old Tara begins to realize the extent of persecution in her native Iraq. When her Kurdish father is sought by the secret police, Tara and her family abandon their home and head north to the mountains. Their refuge is short-lived, however; bombs begin to drop and they flee across the Iranian border to a primitive refugee camp. Stripped of their dignity and still not out of danger, the family plots to leave the continent, despite slim chances of asylum. The author personalizes the Kurdish experience by sensitively portraying Tara's feelings of loss, degradation and uprootedness. Although some readers may find the girl's initial naivete as hard to swallow as her abrupt awakening to violence, most will overlook these minor weaknesses as the story's tension rapidly mounts. Even those familiar with political problems in Iraq and Iran may be shocked by the graphic depiction of tyranny--and may sense that despite their hardships, Tara's family fares better than many people who risk their lives for independence. Ages 10-up. (Apr.)",

    "synopsis": "<P>\"It began as a mistake.\" By middle age, Henry Chinaski has lost more than twelve years of his life to the U.S. Postal Service. In a world where his three true, bitter pleasures are women, booze, and racetrack betting, he somehow drags his hangover out of bed every dawn to lug waterlogged mailbags up mud-soaked mountains, outsmart vicious guard dogs, and pray to survive the day-to-day trials of sadistic bosses and certifiable coworkers. This classic 1971 novel&#8212;the one that catapulted its author to national fame&#8212;is the perfect introduction to the grimly hysterical world of legendary writer, poet, and Dirty Old Man Charles Bukowski and his fictional alter ego, Chinaski.<h3>Gale Research</h3>\"Bukowski's loser's string of anecdotes, convulsively funny and also sad, is unflagging entertainment but in the end doesn't add up to more than the sum of its parts, somehow missing the novelist's alchemy,\" asserts a <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> contributor. But Valentine Cunningham, also writing in the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>, sees the novel as a success: \"Pressed in by Post Office bureaucrats, their mean-minded regulations and their heaps of paperwork, the misfit [Chinaski] looks frequently like an angel of light. His refusal to play respectability ball with the cajoling, abusive, never-take-no-for-an- answer loops who own the mailboxes he attends ... can make even this ribald mess of a wretch seem a shining haven of sanity in the prevailing Los Angeles grimnesses.\"",

    "synopsis": "In This Biography, Sylvia Nasar Re-creates The Life Of A Mathematical Genius Whose Brilliant Career Was Cut Short By Schizophrenia And Who, After Three Decades Of Devastating Mental Illness, Miraculously Recovered And Was Honored With A Nobel Prize. A Beautiful Mind Traces The Meteoric Rise Of John Forbes Nash, Jr., From His Lonely Childhood In West Virginia To His Student Years At Princeton, Where He Encountered Albert Einstein, John Von Neumann, And A Host Of Other Mathematical Luminaries. At Twenty-one, The Handsome, Ambitious, Eccentric Graduate Student Invented What Would Become The Most Influential Theory Of Rational Human Behavior In Modern Social Science. Nash's Contribution To Game Theory Would Ultimately Revolutionize The Field Of Economics. At Thirty, Nash Was Poised To Take His Dreamed-of Place In The Pantheon Of History's Greatest Mathematicians. Then Nash Suffered A Catastrophic Mental Breakdown. Nasar Details Nash's Harrowing Descent Into Insanity - His Bizarre Delusions That He Was The Prince Of Peace; His Resignation From Mit, Flight To Europe, And Attempt To Renounce His American Citizenship; His Repeated Hospitalizations, From The Storied Mclean, Where He Came To Know The Poet Robert Lowell, To The Crowded Wards Of A State Hospital; His Enforced Interludes Of Rationality During Which He Was Able To Return Briefly To Mathematical Research. At Age Sixty-six, Twin Miracles - A Spontaneous Remission Of His Illness And The Sudden Decision Of The Nobel Prize Committee To Honor His Contributions To Game Theory - Restored The World To Him. Nasar Recounts The Bitter Behind-the-scenes Battle In Stockholm Over Whether To Grant The Ultimate Honor In Science To A Man Thought To Be Mad. She Describes Nash's Current Ambition To Pursue New Mathematical Breakthroughs And His Efforts To Be A Loving Father To His Adult Sons.--jacket. Part 1. A Beautiful Mind -- 1.

What Larry Is About To Discover Is That Life Is Never A Straightforward Path. His Girlfriend Becomes Pregnant. They Marry And Set Off For Their Honeymoon In England Where Larry Stumbles Upon What Will Become His Greatest Passion In Life. He Takes Up The Creation And Construction Of Meticulous Mazes, Which Leads Him Down Blind Alleys And Dead Ends, Failed Marriages And Changing Expectations. It All Comes Together In An Unforgettable Dinner Party In This Warm And Witty Coming-of-middle-age Novel. Published Four Years After The Stone Diaries, Larry's Party Won The Uk's Orange Prize For Fiction And Is One Of Carol Shields's Most Critically Successful Works. Published In Numerous Editions By Penguin, The Book Has Now Sold More Than 100,000 Copies In The United States Alone. This Audio Recording, First Released In Audiocassette Canada In 1998, Received Wide Critical Acclaim In Its Original Edition. Quill And Quire Said That This Recording Benefits From Thomson's Cool, Well-trained Voice. There Are No Lilting Cadences Here, Or Perfectly Affected Accents, Just Immaculate Timing And Phrasing. Atlantic Books Today Called This Audio Edition Of Larry's Party A Quietly Rhythmic, Almost Hypnotic Reading. . . . Thomson, Who Advocates Challenging Theatre-goers, Brings The Same Kind Of Respect For His Audience To His Interpretation. This New Btc Edition, Scheduled For Us Release In November, Marks The First Time This Recording Has Been Released In The Us In Any Form And Brings To Life A Work Of Complex Fiction About Anordinary Guy Whose Appearance Belies A Truly Human Complexity.<h3>publishers Weekly</h3>a Chronicle Of One Ordinary Man's Life As He Searches, At First, Bumblingly And Inarticulately For Happiness And The Meaning Of Existence, This Triumphant Novel Runs In Delicious Counterpoint To Shields's Evocation Of Daisy Stone's Life In The Pulitzer Prize-winning <i>the Stone Diaries</i>. In Following Her Male Protagonist Over Five Decades, Shields Observes The Changing Social Conventions, Gender Roles, Vernacular Idiosyncracies And Moral Constructs Of The Times, Interpolating These Details Into The Narrative With Subtle Wit And An Unerring Eye For Telling Details. She Also Delineates The Stages Of Life As The Body Ages And The Future Offers Only The Steady Decline Of Limitless Possibility, While The Mind Hopes For The Solace Of Some Universal Truths. Born In 1950 Into A Blue-collar Household In Winnipeg, Larry Weller Becomes A Floral Designer For Want Of A Better Career Goal. Aware Of His Lack Of Education, Awkward And Sexually Timid (his Eventual Sexual Awakening Is Both Raunchy And Funny), Larry Is Dimly Conscious Of Another Aspect Of Life Beyond His Parochial Horizons. Only During His First Honeymoon In England, Willfully Lost Inside The Maze At Hampton Court, Does He Get A Glimmer That He Might Be More Than A Man Of Limited Imagination And Few Choices. When His Fascination With Shrubby Labyrinths Becomes A Professional Career, Larry Moves Into A Wider World (and From Canada To The U.s. And Back Again) As A Financially Successful And Internationally Recognized Maze Builder. He Also Endures Emotional Traumas: The Breakup Of Two Marriages, Estrangement From His Son, Midlife Crisis And A Catastrophic Illness. Meanwhile, He Is Plagued With Inchoate Longings To Understand The Dimly Perceived Relationship Between The Mazes He Constructs And The Undertow Of Something Missing In His Existence. Shields Offers Snippets Of Larry's Journey Through Life In Short Chapters That Often Intersect And Double Back; A Turn Here, A Repetition There. The Pathway Of Her Maze Becomes Clear Only At The End, When Larry And His Lover Give A Party To Celebrate The Coincidence Of His Two Ex-wives Arriving In Toronto. Evoked In A Brilliant Cascade Of Conversation In Which The Central Question Is What's It Like Being A Man In The Last Days Of The 20th Century? The Party Provides Larry With Epiphanic Insight, And The Reader With Some Delightful Surprises. The Novel Glows With Shield's Unsentimental Optimism And Her Supple Command Of A Sweetly Ironic And Graceful Prose.",

The victim: a beautiful little girl, savagely beaten - and deposited in front of the elementary school Cross's son, Damon, attends. Could there be a connection between the two murders? As Cross tries to put the pieces together, the killer - or killers - strike again. And again. No one in Washington is safe - not children, not politicians, not even the President of the United States. Only Alex Cross has the skills and the courage to crack the case - but will he discover the truth in time?",

    "synopsis": "<P>&#8220;What a wild ride &#8212; I couldn&#8217;t turn the pages fast enough,&#8221; Oprah Winfrey told her viewers as she announced <b>Fall on Your Knees</b> as her February 2002 Book Club selection. Set largely in a Cape Breton coal mining community called New Waterford, ranging through four generations, Ann-Marie MacDonald&#8217;s dark, insightful and hilarious first novel focuses on the Piper sisters and their troubled relationship with their father, James. Winner of the 1997 Commonwealth Writers Prize for Best First Book, it was a national bestseller in Canada for two years, and it has been translated into 17 languages.<P>At the start of the 20th century, James Piper sets fire to his dead mother&#8217;s piano and heads out across Cape Breton Island to find a new place to live, eventually eloping with 13-year-old Materia Mahmoud, the daughter of wealthy, traditional Lebanese parents. And so, from early on, Ann-Marie MacDonald establishes some major themes&#58; racial tension, isolation, passion and forbidden love, which will gradually lead to incest, death in childbirth, and even murder. At the centre of this epic story is the nature of family love, beginning with the Piper sister who depend on one another for survival. Their development as characters &#8212; beautiful Kathleen, the promising diva; saintly Mercedes; Frances, the mischievous bad girl, who tries to bear the family&#8217;s burden; and disabled Lily, everyone&#8217;s favourite &#8212; forms the heart of the novel. And then there is James, their flawed father.<P>Moving from Cape Breton Island to the battlefields of World War I, to Harlem in New York&#8217;s Jazz Age and the Depression, the tense and enthralling plotof <b>Fall on Your Knees</b> contains love, pain, death, joy, and triumph. The structure of the narrative is multi-faceted, richly layered, and shifts back and forth through time as it approaches the story from different angles, &#8220;giving it a mythic quality<i> </i>that allows dark, half buried secrets to be gracefully and chillingly revealed&#8221; (<i>The New York Times Book Review).</i> As the details of the labyrinthine plot are pulled together, the question of whether it is possible to escape one&#8217;s family history gradually raises itself.<P>The book&#8217;s epigraph, taken from <b>Wuthering Heights</b>, seems appropriate to a novel concerned with the different, often violent, forms that love can take. On the inexorable journey towards tragedy we encounter dark yet vivid images of neglect and violence, yet the novel radiates an unquenchable life-force, and yet the novel radiates an unquenchable life-force, shimmering with emotional depth, sensual with virtuoso descriptions of the power of music. It is a saga haunted by ghosts and saints, religious fanaticism and magic. MacDonald gives the most ordinary lives extraordinarily dramatic dimensions.<P>The <i>Sunday Times</i> wrote, &quot;It is the unpredictability of this huge book that is its greatest joy.&quot; With allusions ranging from Hollywood stars to religious tracts, <b>Fall on Your Knees</b> simmers with vibrancy and crackling, effervescent, breathtaking language.<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>Not a single line is superfluous in this richly layered tale of the secrets within several generations of a Canadian family. Both feverishly intense and darkly humorous, the drama of the Piper family emerges amidst a backdrop of racial tension and social change in Canada during the first half of the 20th century. Piano tuner James Piper dotes on his beautiful and musically talented eldest daughter, Kathleen, almost to the exclusion of everyone else, including his Lebanese wife and his other daughters. After Kathleen's death during childbirth and his wife's suicide a few days later, James forbids any mention of Kathleen's name. But the bitter fruit of illicit passion will continue to take its toll on Kathleen's survivors. Though the mortality rate in this family sometimes challenges credibility, playwright and actress MacDonald's ambitious first novel displays a remarkable assurance of style, pacing and plotting as unexpected twists propel a complex story that builds inexorably to tragedy. MacDonald uses the surface tension and love between James and his daughters to explore the repercussions of repression, sin, guilt and violence that simmer beneath the family's delicately maintained equilibrium. Her gifts for character development, comic dialogue and vivid evocation of social milieu and specific background detail-from Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, to New York City in the 1920s-add texture to an entrancing narrative. Literary Guild and Doubleday Book Club alternate selections; author tour. (Apr.) FYI: MacDonald began this book as a play but finished it five years later as her first work of fiction. Fall on Your Knees was previously published in Canada, where it rose to the top of the bestseller lists.",

Unable to find him, alone and desperate, she is found instead by Mr. Hilditch, an obese catering manger, collector and befriender of homeless girls, who is also searching &#8212; in a way Felicia could never have imagined...<h3>Publishers Weekly</h3>Trevor, long admired for his trenchant stories and novels, his subtle humor and broad compassion, retains all those virtues in his deeply absorbing new novel and adds a degree of narrative tension he has not shown before. Felicia is a poor, plain, rather simple Irish girl made pregnant by the first boy to bed her, who then promptly disappears to England, leaving no address. When she abandons her taciturn family to look for him, her only thought is to be reunited with a lover. But she meets portly, self-delighted Mr. Hilditch, catering manager at a factory in the grimy English Midlands, who shows her unexpected kindness, even helps arrange an abortion for her; after all, he's been a good friend to so many other lost girls, hasn't he? Wary of him at first, then resigned, finally increasingly anxious as she wonders what became of his other friends, Felicia picks her numb way among psychological minefields. What happens to her and to Mr. Hilditch, in the brilliantly evoked setting of dank cafes and pubs, homeless wanderers, revivalists and bus trips to stately homes, is the stuff of nightmare; not cynically created, but one born of deep understanding and piercing truth. This is a thriller lifted to the level of high art, and it should win Trevor many new admirers. BOMC selection. (Jan.)",

    "synopsis": "Love is often a mystery to teenagers - sometimes painful, other times glorious, always challenging. This book will help them understand and sort out their myriad feelings and experiences. Rather than merely offering one adult's opinions or reflections on love, Kirberger deftly combines material from teens dealing with firsthand adolescent love with that from adults sensitive to the special needs of teens. She includes original letters she has received from teens, along with her responses to their questions, concerns and confusion. This blend provides a wide-ranging perspective on love and relationships. It will enable teens to gain wisdom and choose more wisely when making decisions in love and relationships. \nThis book is designed to guide teens through the maze of love and relationships in a gentle, understanding and compassionate way. It isn't a dos-and-don'ts manual, but rather a how-it-is-in-love guidebook. Teens will come to treasure it as a wise and loving counselor and companion. On the roller-coaster ride of teen love, this is one book no teen can afford to be without.\nCheck out the companion book, Teen Love : A Journal on Relationships, co-authored with Colin Mortensen of MTV's Real World/Hawaii.\n\n\n                        Combines personal advice with poetry and stories about teenage love and relationships.\n",

Both The Los Angeles And San Francisco Bay Areas Sit Astride Two Of The Most Violently Seismic Zones On The Planet. The Earthquakes That Have Already Rocked California Were, According To Reisner, Mere Prologues To A Future Cataclysm That Will Result In Destruction Of Such Magnitude That The Only Recourse Will Be To Rebuild From The Ground Up.

In Naked, Sedaris turns the mania for memoir on its ear, mining the exceedingly rich terrain of his life, his family, and his unique worldview-a sensibility at once take-no-prisoners sharp and deeply charitable. A tart-tongued mother does dead-on imitations of her young son's nervous tics, to the great amusement of his teachers; a stint of Kerouackian wandering is undertaken (of course!) with a quadriplegic companion; a family gathers for a wedding in the face of imminent death. Through it all is Sedaris's unmistakable voice, without doubt one of the freshest in American writing.</b><h3>Details</h3>One of the most talked-about, most enjoyed bestsellers of the year, <i>Naked</i> offers a collection of hilarious, touching, genre-bending vignettes. . .",

In the myths of the Teutons, an ancient people who occupied Jutland around 100 B.C., the wind was pictured as a huge dog who served as chief attendant to Odin, the Norse god of wisdom and war, and was responsible for the cosmos. They thought that when it rained very hard, Odin's dog, in the form of the wind, was chasing a cat, who took the form of the rain. So the Teutons believed that when it poured, Odin dropped cats and dogs from the sky.This is just one of the many fascinating stories behind the dozens of idioms and common phrases we use every day.

But no one knows about the early life of the Son of God, the missing years — except Biff, the Messiah's best bud, who has been resurrected to tell the story in the divinely hilarious yet heartfelt work \"reminiscent of Vonnegut and Douglas Adams\" (<b>Philadelphia Inquirer</b>).\nVerily, the story Biff has to tell is a miraculous one, filled with remarkable journeys, magic, healings, kung fu, corpse reanimations, demons, and hot babes. Even the considerable wiles and devotion of the Savior's pal may not be enough to divert Joshua from his tragic destiny. But there's no one who loves Josh more — except maybe \"Maggie,\" Mary of Magdala — and Biff isn't about to let his extraordinary pal suffer and ascend without a fight.",

Now, in the second of her New Tales of the Vampires, she tells the mesmerizing story of Vittorio, a vampire in the Italian Age of Gold. \nEducated in the Florence of Cosimo de' Medici, trained in knighthood at his father's mountaintop castle, Vittorio inhabits a world of courtly splendor and country pleasures--a world suddenly threatened when his entire family is confronted by an unholy power.\nIn the midst of this upheaval, Vittorio is seduced by the vampire Ursula, the most beautiful of his supernatural enemies. As he sets out in pursuit of vengeance, entering the nightmarish Court of the Ruby Grail, increasingly more enchanted (and confused) by his love for the mysterious Ursula, he finds himself facing demonic adversaries, war and political intrigue.\nAgainst a backdrop of the wonders--both sacred and profane--and the beauty and ferocity of Renaissance Italy, Anne Rice creates a passionate and tragic legend of doomed young love and lost innocence.",

But the day before his release, his wife and best friend are killed in an accident. On the plane home to the funeral, he meets Mr. Wednesday—a beguiling stranger who seems to know everything about him. A trickster and rogue, Mr. Wednesday offers Shadow a job as his bodyguard. With nowhere left to go, Shadow accepts, and soon learns that his role in Mr. Wednesday's schemes will be far more dangerous and dark than he could have ever imagined. For beneath the placid surface of everyday life a war is being fought—and the prize is the very soul of America.\n\n\n                        <b>Winner of the 2002 Hugo Award for Best Novel<br>\nWinner of the 2002 Nebula Award for Best Novel<br>\nWinner of the 2002 Bram Stoker Award for Best Novel</b>\n",

    "synopsis": "Well, this was when Bill was sighing a lot. He had decided that after our parents died he just didn't want any more fighting between what was left of us. He was twenty-four, Beth was twenty-three, I was twenty-one, Toph was eight, and all of us were so tried already, from that winter. So when something world come up, any little thing, some bill to pay or decision to make, he would just sigh, his eyes tired, his mouth in a sorry kind of smile. But Beth and I...Jesus, we were fighting with everyone, anyone, each other, with strangers at bars, anywhere -- we were angry people wanting to exact revenge. We came to California and we wanted everything, would take what was ours, anything within reach. And I decided that little Toph and I, he with his backward hat and long hair, living together in our little house in Berkeley, would be world-destroyers. We inherited each other and, we felt, a responsibility to reinvent everything, to scoff and re-create and drive fast while singing loudly and pounding the windows. It was a hopeless sort of exhilaration, a kind of arrogance born of fatalism, I guess, of the feeling that if you could lose a couple of parents in a month, then basically anything could happen, at any time -- all bullets bear your name, all cars are there to crush you, any balcony could give way; more disaster seemed only logical. And then, as in Dorothy's dream, all these people I grew up with were there, too, some of them orphans also, most but not all of us believing that what we had been given was extraordinary, that it was time to tear or break down, ruin, remake, take and devour. This was San Francisco, you know, and everyone had some dumb idea -- I mean, <i>wicca?</i> -- and no one there would tell you yours was doomed. Thus the public nudity, and this ridiculous magazine, and the <i>Real World</i> tryout, all this need, most of it disguised by sneering, but all driven by a hyper-awareness of this window, I guess, a few years when your muscles are taut, coiled up and vibrating. But what to do with the energy? I mean, when we drive, Toph and I, and we drive past people, standing on top of all these hills, part of me wants to stop the car and turn up the radio and have us all dance in formation, and part of me wants to run them all over.\n\n\n                        Dave Eggers' memoir of bringing up his younger brother after his parent's death, has been shortlisted for the Guardian First Book Award, which aims to recognise and reward new writing across fiction and non-fiction.\n",

    "synopsis": "<P><i>The Dress Lodger</i>, a cunning historical thriller charged with a distinctly modern voice, is the book that launched Sheri Holman into bestsellerdom. With over 300,000 copies sold and a consistent top &#147;Reader&#8217;s Circle&#8221; performer for Ballantine, it was superbly reviewed, chosen as a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book, and nominated for the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award. <P>In Sunderland, England, a city quarantined by the cholera epidemic of 1831, Gustine, a defiant fifteen-year-old beauty in an elegant blue dress rented from her pimp-landlord, sells her body to feed her only love&#58; a fragile baby boy. When she meets surgeon Henry Chiver, who has recently been implicated in the Burke and Hare killings, in which beggars were murdered so the corpses could be sold for medical research, Gustine begins working for him by securing cadavers for his ill-equipped anatomy school. It is a gruesome job that will soon threaten the very things she&#8217;s working so hard to protect.<h3>Salon - Marion Lignana Rosenberg</h3>Compulsively fascinating, the novel draws the reader through the alleys and quays of Sunderland with all the practiced charm of its title character.

    "synopsis": "<P>&quot;When I was little I would think of ways to kill my daddy. I would figure out this or that way and run it down through my head until it got easy.&quot; So begins the tale of Ellen Foster, the brave and engaging heroine of Kay Gibbons's first novel, which won the Sue Kaufman Prize from the American Academy of Institute of Arts and Letters. Wise, funny, affectionate, and true, <b>Ellen Foster</b> is, as Walker Percy called it, &quot;The real thing. Which is to say, a lovely, sometimes heartwrenching novel. . . . [Ellen Foster] is as much a part of the backwoods South as a Faulkner character&#8212;and a good deal more endearing.&quot;<h3>Alice Hoffman</h3>If one should never trust the person who has had a happy childhood, then Ellen Foster, the 11-year-old heroine of Kaye Gibbons's accomplished first novel, may be the most trustworthy character in recent fiction....In many ways this is an old-fashioned novel about traditional values and inherited prejudices, taking place in a South where too little has changed too slowly....What might have been grim, melodramatic material in the hands of a less talented author is instead filled with lively humor, compassion and intimacy. This short novel focuses on Ellen's strengths rather than her victimization, presenting a memorable heroine who rescues herself. -- <i>New York Times</i>",

And now it looks as if her controversial theory is in fact chilling reality. For Christopher Dicken, a \"virus hunter\" at the Epidemic Intelligence Service, has pursued an elusive flu-like disease that strikes down expectant mothers and their offspring. Then a major discovery high in the Alps —the preserved bodies of a prehistoric family—reveals a shocking link: something that has slept in our genes for millions of years is waking up.\nNow, as the outbreak of this terrifying disease threatens to become a deadly epidemic, Dicken and Lang must race against time to assemble the pieces of a puzzle only they are equipped to solve—an evolutionary puzzle that will determine the future of the human race . . . if a future exists at all.",

A visionary financier's biotechnology company has succeeded in cloning these extinct reptiles. Fifteen different species, presumably incapable of breeding, are now placidly roaming around, but Jurassic Park's resident mathematician, an expert in chaos theory, predicts that the animals' behavior is inherently unstable. When a rival genetics firm attempts to steal frozen dinosaur embryos, things go haywire. Two cute American kids, eight-year-old Tina and 11-year-old Tim, a safari guide from Kenya and a Denver paleontologist set things aright--almost. Though the dinosaurs here are more interesting than the people, Crichton ( The Andromeda Strain ) ingeniously interweaves details of genetic engineering, computer wizardry and current scientific controversy over dinosaurs to fashion a scary, creepy, mesmerizing techno-thriller with teeth. It can be read as a thought-provoking fable about technological hubris and the hazards of bioengineering. 150,000 first printing; Literary Guild main selection; movie rights sold to Steven Spielberg/Universal Pictures .

    "synopsis": "One of the world's first best-sellers, this tragic masterpiece attained an instant and lasting success upon its 1774 publication. A sensitive exploration of the mind of a young artist, the tale addresses age-old questions--the meaning of love, of death, and the possibility of redemption--in the form of Werther's alternately joyful and despairing letters about his unrequited love. Goethe's portrayal of a character who struggles to reconcile his artistic sensibilities with the demands of the objective world proved tremendously influential to subsequent writers and continues to speak to modern readers.                        Deeply felt poems by a poet with a singularly unique voice.",

    "synopsis": "Discovered in the attic in which she spent the last years of her life, Anne Frank's remarkable diary has since become a world classic—a powerful reminder of the horrors of war and an eloquent testament to the human spirit. In 1942, with Nazis occupying Holland, a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl and her family fled their home in Amsterdam and went into hiding. For the next two years, until their whereabouts were betrayed to the Gestapo, they and another family lived cloistered in the \"Secret Annex\" of an old office building. Cut off from the outside world, they faced hunger, boredom, the constant cruelties of living in confined quarters, and the ever-present threat of discovery and death. In her diary Anne Frank recorded vivid impressions of her experiences during this period. By turns thoughtful, moving, and amusing, her account offers a fascinating commentary on human courage and frailty and a compelling self-portrait of a sensitive and spirited young woman whose promise was tragically cut short.\n\n\n                        The journal of a Jewish girl in her early teens describes both the joys and torments of daily life, as well as typical adolescent thoughts, throughout two years spent in hiding with her family during the Nazi occupation of Holland.\n",

    "synopsis": "As she has done in her novels <i>Eden Close</i>, <i>Strange Fits of Passion</i>, and <i>Where or When</i>, Anita Shreve once again leads readers into a harrowing world where lives are catastrophically overturned by emotion. Set in a Belgian village amid the wreckage of World War II, <i>Resistance</i> is a powerful exploration of passion, self-discovery, and sacrifice from one of our most accomplished storytellers. Just as the Nazi occupation forces have drained her village of coffee, meat, and chocolate, the war has also depleted whatever joy there may have been in Claire Daussois's marriage. On their small farm in the south of Belgium, Claire and her husband, Henri, shelter refugees - Jews, Allied pilots, and fleeing Belgian soldiers - before passing them along toward France and freedom. Claire nurses the wounded, acts as interpreter, and waits for the war to end - and, in a way she finds difficult to admit even to herself, for her own life to change. And it does, when an American B-17 bomber is downed near their village. The pilot, badly injured, is found by a young boy who turns to Claire for help in saving him. Henri is away on Resistance work. As the pilot heals and recovers in her attic hiding place, Claire begins to awaken to the possibility of love. Over the course of a mere twenty days, closed off from the world and the war in her farmhouse, Claire and Lieutenant Ted Brice experience a life-changing passion that neither has felt before. That their love is also haunted and impossible only makes it more precious. The war recedes in the face of their joy - before imposing itself once more with shocking suddenness and inconceivable horror. Resistance is the story of a young Belgian woman, an American pilot, and the small war-torn village that shelters them. Richly peopled and fearlessly, gorgeously passionate, it is a powerful exploration of emotion at odds with commitment. No reader who has loved - or resisted love - will forget this lucid and moving tale.",

H. G. Wells and George Bernard Shaw thought it one of the funniest plays ever written, and it has continued to amuse theatergoers the world over for more than a century. The play pokes fun at the aristocracy, the literary world, and British manners and customs, while calling into question the very notion of identity. The characters plans are constantly sent topsy-turvy by unexpected turns of events. Along the way, Wilde s wit-sharpened dialogue skewers nearly everyone, throwing into high relief the strains of class pretension, social ambition, and romantic gamesmanship.<br><br>Readers who have enjoyed Oscar Wilde s barbed prose will find his pointed dramatic dialogue equally enticing.",

    "synopsis": "<br>\n \n<i>On Her Own Ground</i> is the first full-scale, definitive biography of Madam C. J. Walker — the legendary African American entrepreneur and philanthropist — by her great-great-granddaughter, A'Lelia Bundles.\nThe daughter of slaves, Madam C. J. Walker was orphaned at seven, married at fourteen and widowed at twenty. She spent the better part of the next two decades laboring as a washerwoman for $1.50 a week. Then — with the discovery of a revolutionary hair care formula for black women — everything changed. By her death in 1919, Walker managed to overcome astonishing odds: building a storied beauty empire from the ground up, amassing wealth unprecedented among black women and devoting her life to philanthropy and social activism. Along the way, she formed friendships with great early-twentieth-century politi-cal figures such as W.E.B. Du Bois and Booker T. Washington.\n <i>On Her Own Ground</i> is not only the first comprehensive biography of one of recent history's most amazing entrepreneurs and philanthropists, it is about a woman who is truly an African American icon. Drawn from more than two decades of exhaustive research, the book is enriched by the author's exclusive access to personal letters, records and never-before-seen photographs from the family collection. Bundles also showcases Walker's complex relationship with her daughter, A'Lelia Walker, a celebrated hostess of the Harlem Renaissance and renowned friend to both Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston. In chapters such as \"Freedom Baby,\" \"Motherless Child,\" \"Bold Moves\" and \"Black Metropolis,\" Bundles traces her ancestor's improbable rise to the top of an international hair care empire that would be run by four generations of Walker women until its sale in 1985. Along the way, <i>On Her Own Ground</i> reveals surprising insights, tells fascinating stories and dispels many misconceptions.",
